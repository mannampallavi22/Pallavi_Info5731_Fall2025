1,love the note 3 i really love the galaxy note 3 and i have had absolutely no problems with it it does everything and more i am sorry the newest version 7 has been such a disaster but i think there must have been a flaw in the sealed waterproof design i am so glad i settled on the older version tried and true for less money and virtually no down side at all the galaxy note 3 phone is such an awesome phone i feel very badly for the company at this time also the company which sent it did so quickly arrived earlier than expected,positive
2,attention tracfone users amazingly this works with tracfone before we used a iphone 4s verizon bought from amazon and transferred to tracfone byop successfully and everything still works today didn't know of tracfone's changes so now it's at t unlocked phones t mobile and some other various carriers that can be brought into byop not verizon as it was a byop carrier before transfer old tracfone cellphone to this newer samsung already had a sim card meant for the process strangely before the iphone 4s didn't need a sim card still doesn't have one but still on that tracfone plan for the iphone the byop process didn't work right away when we tried transferring it online called tracfone for assistance blah blah provided information this that op nope your phone isn't compatible with tracfone sorry and bye however we tried transferring online again and it worked successfully results it uses at t cell towers makes calls and everything successfully image transfers through text messages is iffy since it can't send multiple images in bulk just make sure to go through the steps listed for byop do it once or twice and image transfer along with data usage should work fine,positive
3,i love this phone table phablet this phone is fabulous i had an iphone 4 and really didn't need anything fancy or better but got tired of the updates and being it was a 4 it was too old for many newer things i wanted something that i could read books on that is large enough like a kindle but use as a phone as well this phone is it for me phablet yeah ok i call it awesome perfect in size to read books not too big that it still is ok to use as phone while holding it up to your ear it is bigger than most phones but with all the features as hands free gestures and so many features i am still learning about i recommend this to anyone wanting the cross between a tablet and a cell phone many others give great detail to the phone i am simply going to say its fast battery lasts longs if you remember to close applications you're not using so many smart features and way better than iphone 4 i love android and all the same apps pretty much as itunes has plus google play store kindle app for books its endless love it,positive
4,worked great no accessories worked just like it was straight out of the box it was great to be able to charge again after my original note 3 was rusted and corroded around the port it was a little tricky to figure out how to change out the sim card apparently according to youtube videos you need the tool which came in the original box there is no way that you could do it by hand i had no luck with a pair of tweezers and even with the original tool took me a few attempts to get the sim card out once put in the new phone i didn't even have to call verizon it worked immediately i also purchased a 128gb memory stick to transfer all of my photos and videos from the old phone it's memory was full so i couldn't upload through the internet and the port was corroded so usb wouldn't work this phone did not come with the stylus or the charger i found two generic chargers for about 8 on amazon and i took my stylus from the old phone overall happy with the purchase and everything worked great only downside in the whole experience for me was that i lost some of my contacts in the transfer i believe that some are stored locally on the phone and some are google contacts there didn't seem to be much rhyme or reason but i now make sure that i store them all as google contacts,positive
5,very pleased with this phone i have had this phone for a little over a month now and am extremely happy with it i love everything about it except the visual voicemail update that wont go away i do not want visual voicemail and besides that verizon wants to charge 2 99 a month for it i won't go into this any further as it will just spark more rants about unwanted software bloat ware the problem with this particular piece of crapware is that notifications continually pop up and sit in the notifications bar at the top of the phone if you clear it it comes back and there is no way to turn it off either this is the reason for taking off 1 star off the phone s rating other than that the phone is a real performer takes wonderful pictures and video and is still slim enough to fit nicely in my back pocket the phone is big but so are my hands and it could not fit them better this is truly a where have you been all my life moment having this phone the larger display is just awesome and the pen works great too this phone would be a perfect 10 without the software bloat ware thing but hey where would the world be without annoying salespeople trying to sell you what you don t want or need anyway the battery life has been great for me most times i can go 2 days without a charge i do turn my phone off at night though and i don t play games on it with the exception of bubble shoot i went from the droid razr maxx to this phone and i loved that phone well i thought i did until i got this phone i was hesitant going away from motorola equipment as i have always had some sort of motorola device because they are made so well really glad i made this switch,positive
6,still learning transitioning from iphone great phone although i miss the integrated features that the iphone provides excellent battery i haven't found aftermarket apps but in my transition i've noticed what i do love great screen size to read everything comfortably watch video clips and appreciate pictures great battery life i had to charge the iphone i had twice a day this i abuse and it still gets me through the day it also has a removable battery for instant juice family i have in the philippines have had to charge theirs 3 4 times a day due to the network infrastructure responsive in my transition things i have noticed native list syncing is not present i decided to go with wunderlist i would have used google task but it's not developed yet no button that pulls up voice command like siri does in the lock screen the voice command is not universal and not as easily accessible like siri was you can have it activate in the lock screen with a double tap of the home button but it doesn't work if the phone is unlocked if it is unlocked you have to find the app there is a buttonless voice activation hi galaxy but it stops working sometimes google maps will persist in lock mode but only if you don't hit the home button to summon the unlock screen when you do that the map disappears and you must unlock the phone to see it again the iphone will always show the map when navigating while locked which was really nice some apps tend to freeze i simply hold down the home button and swipe to close a running program and then reopen it the text size kept changing on me every time i tried to text i found you change the default text size with the volume buttons i had to be creative to migrate my contacts i moved everything to google from my iphone then synced with my phone one thing that is great is that i can manage my contacts now through google contacts through my gmail they have a tool to remove duplicate contacts text to speech engine is awesome better than siri in accuracy and speed i think camera and playlist controls aren't available in the lock screen as they were with the iphone unless you disable security i've used the pen when in phone calls to jot down and auto call the numbers i write afterwards which is really nice after the novelty of the pen i reverted to using the on screen keyboard i still use it on occasion i like the availability especially when sending information to people or writing on maps i have used the s note notebooks to draw guitar chords and strumming patterns so that's really nice i just wish there was more integration so i can see my notebooks on my computer for a case i used the otterbox commuter which works well it has no belt clip but i would imagine i'd get tired of putting on the clip after a while anyway this just slides into my pocket did i enjoy my iphone yes simple works well integrated robust although sometimes non responsive and poor battery life do i enjoy the galaxy note yes totally different experience with the larger screen great battery life more enjoyment of pictures video it's not as well integrated but it works and does what i want in a mobile computing device phone that i have on me all the time the screen snappiness battery life and pen bring really make it and are much more important in the experience will i stay i think so i will learn the phone soon enough the experience is just different if you have any comments please do i'm still learning the phone it is a great piece of art and master craftsmanship from samsung it comes from south korea a powerhouse of cutting edge technology and force in the global economy i was there for a year and can appreciate the history not to be confused with china or japan,positive
7,favorite smartphone ive had this is definitely the best phone i've owned my previous were the samsung fascinate galaxy 1 and then the galaxy s3 i have always prefered samsung devices i like apples hardware but i hate ios so i stick to android devices after working several jobs selling cell phones and working with them all the time i always choose to buy samsung i just think the galaxy series phones have been really good well the time came for my s3 to upgrade and i was planning on getting the newest s phone which at the time was the s5 after playing around with one for a bit i just wasn't crazy about it it seemed bigger than my s3 by a noticeable amount and had some annoying features that were unable to be turned off i didn't care about the s health or anything like that i care about speed and features thats where the note shines it is a large phone but its actually not that much bigger than an s5 an s5 with an otterbox is bigger than my note with a slim grip case i have now had the phone for a couple months and pocketing it is no big deal at all also the note has awesome features s window is really cool as well as scrapbooker s note is useful for reminders or jotting down a number or something really quick s draw is really cool to use the pen even comes in handy for texting and normal web use its screen is also really nice not quite 1080p but its 720p it looks just fine i watch videos on it all the time all in all i highly recommend the note 3 the note 4 hardware and build quality materials are better its more expensive and has some slightly annoying features though consider a note as your next phone over a galaxy s not to m,positive
8,so far i am really loving this phone i don't use a cell phone a lot but i love the functionality of this phone it is more like a mini tablet the pen that comes with it is very handy and activates the phone when you pull it out it is also great for more precise selections and for note taking i am very happy with the resolution of the screen and the response of both touch and pen buying the phone from amazon and setting up a new verizon account was painless i easily got the account and on line payment set up without a hitch i also transferred my at t phone number to the phone without any problems i won't reiterate the tech specs of the phone as you can read all of that on the product page i just want to let you know what i think of it as a user of the phone at this point in time i couldn't be happier with this phone or the verizon service update 5 07 16 i've had this phone for a little over 3 years and i still have no desire to get a new phone i did however recently decide to switch my service provider from verizon to t mobile because of the offerings of t mobile which i won't get into i was assured by the t mobile rep that as long as the phone was unlocked i could replace the verizon sim card with the one from t mobile and the phone would work with no problems after activating the t mobile sim card i am updating this review so that others don't experience what i did if they want to change their provider first of all verizon has never locked any of their 4g phones verizon uses a cdma network which is also used by sprint and us cellular t mobile and at s use a gsm network one difference is the polarity used so phone for each type of network are manufactured to use the specific polarity of the network the other difference that should be considered by the end user is that on the gsm network customer information is stored on the sim card this means that you can take the sim card from one phone and insert it into another and it will work gsm carriers must accept any gsm phone so they don't have control over the phone you are using cdma carriers use network based white lists so you can only switch phones with your carrier's permission and the carrier doesn't have to accept any particular phone there are other differences between the two network types but those i have mentioned affect the end user the most in my case i had to buy a new phone in order to switch to t mobile as a carrier i was also told by verizon that this phone may work with another cdma carrier but it my lose functionality i have had to buy another phone to use the gsm network and have decided to get the galaxy note 4 since i have to give up my note 3 i hope this helps other in choosing a carrier and a phone,positive
9,great camera and sound large but slim durable 'rich' looking best phone i've had so far switched from at t to verizon with this phone and glad i did customer service has been excellent there were problems with overheating and the battery draining quickly which you can see via an internet search verizon replaced the phone but i found that the problem really seems tied to google updating syncing photos and videos once i turned that off and only do it on demand and when plugged in the problem seems solved have not been thrilled by the note feature but that is probably just my ignorance excellent camera and i love the google voice search response feature of course that's an android not just the note 3 i am fairly careful with my phones so haven't put a screensaver on it nor do i use a case most of the time due to the weight and find the phone and screen to be pretty durable it still looks like new after about 2 years it's large and rather unwieldy but for my old eyes ability to see things on the screen makes up for it it is slim and light enough to not be a problem the sound is really good too i almost always use the speakerphone on it for making calls and like the sound when i play music or listen to audio books and i'm fussy i haven't tried other brands so can't comment on how the note 3 compares tho i did look at them in the store before settling on this phone,positive
10,great phone i bought this phone in december 2013 l still love it the drawback is its size l hare small hands and it can be difficult to grasp because it is big it is also heavier than my previous phones the size is why i bought it though l wanted the big screen and it is worth it lt is very durable i did put a case on it but it is a lightweight one that only covers the edges and back i have dropped my phone many times with no damage samsung does have a lot of useless programs that come pre installed but i haven't had issues with those my battery easily lasts all day most days if the battery seems to be draining quickly clearing the cache and restarting the phone seems to solve the problem the on screen keyboard is easier to use on the bigger screen the split windows are now useable games are easier to play everything is easier to read one more drawback is that the volume buttons and power button are directly opposite of each other i often end up pressing both at the same time the rest of the phone isn't much different from the galaxy nexus the programs are the same the screens look the same only bigger,neutral
11,love at first sight this was a long anticipated wait for me i have been waiting since november 2012 to get my hands on one of these i would frantically search to see the latest stats pro's and cons and i must say the phone is perfect i am amazed at how huge the screen is all the while the phone is soooo lightweight it is very slim and feels as if nothing is in my hand i have toyed with some things at first glance the graphics have my pupils like woooooow i made the tragic mistake of bluetoothing over all my pics from my previous phone first before downloading apps and its about 1200 photos videos and music my fault for that drained my battery but other than that on first hand i love love love love my new phone 1 25 14 it is nice to have a phone that can go 1 day and a half without being on charge i took phone off charge at 745am worked 13 hours and went out to the bar after work took pics and mild to moderate social networking while at work shhh lol and went to sleep with battery at 33 woke up 7 hours later phone is on 30 love love love my phone i do frequently make sure i close all apps on the phone to conserve my battery still learning new things on my phone,positive
12,best phone i've ever owned this phone does everything i could ask of it i'm a student and this thing is absolutely amazing for taking notes editing documents reading etc i also love to play games which it will handle everything out there i would not say that this phone is for everybody because of its shear size and capabilities my 60 year old father would not be able to figure this thing out because of all the customization it offers beware this phone is extremely big like comically big unless you have andre the giant hands you probably wont be able to reach from one end of the screen to the other while one handed texting with that being said i am always worried that i will drop it so i suggest always using both hands i am a very heavy user so the battery usually lasts me about an entire day with about 15 left but i like my brightness maxed out wifi on games syncing blah blah blah my old galaxy s3 would require a charge in the middle of the day just to make it to the end of the day with how much i use it tl dr i love this phone and would recommend it to anybody who needs to multitask and often burns through their battery during the day,positive
13,love the phone first of all i want to say that amazon price beats any service provider offers out there secondly the quick shipment from amazon and processing is awesome now the phone i love love love everything about it it is big in size but how many people have a smartphone plus a tablet i find this phone serves the purpose of both i love how everything is in one i was always in love with the android operating system so i never really had much of a problem i found i got really frustrated with apple products a lot and switching to the iphone was the biggest regret i had made i just don't like how everything is set up for you and you can't really customize anything secondly i love how the note syncs with my google account from my gmail to my calendar and my contacts i am currently taking online classes and i am able to log on to my school website without a problem as opposed to my iphone i can only access certain features and not to mention constantly having to zoom in cons speaker is on the bottom so if you watch a movie in landscape you'll feel like your hearing is off that's all i can find for it for now,positive
14,update do not install update to android 5 0 lollipop update last week april 28 2015 verizon pushed the android 5 0 lollipop update for the note 3 do not install the update there have been multiple problems with the update my particular problem has been if the phone is in a no coverage area for a length of time when you get back into a coverage area it will not pick the signal back up until you reboot the phone i am now waiting on my 3rd phone from verizon to deal with this and their only remedy at this point is not to install the update look online before you consider updating and read all the issues with this update original review i transitioned from a motorola droid razr maxx to this samsung galaxy note 3 a difference between night and day i have literally moved from the worst phone i have ever owned to the absolute best phone i have ever owned pros quad core replaceable up gradable battery beautiful display s pen call quality available accessories app compatibility cons i'll let you know if i find one,positive
15,beautiful phone well worth the money you won't regret it quick reference review details below fantastic all around beautifully crisp screen in full hd very quick response time for all around performance from texts to apps to games battery life is astounding average users will have no problem going throughout a day on one battery or even two connection on verizon is fast for both data and calls i haven't experience any call quality issues camera qualities are second to none the s pen is a nice feature to have phone layout buttons is easy to get used too i can use this phone easily with one hand but i have big hands in general if your only issue with this phone is its size get it you easily get used to the size and don't even notice it however i wouldnt recommend to individuals with tiny hands comment with any other questions ill try to get back as quick as i can bought this phone off amazon in january 2 months ago due to its amazing deal and reduced price and i am not at all dissatisfied worth noting i purchased this phone over the lg g2 i do have a single significant complaint on this phone regarding the charger scroll to the bottom for that design the layout and physical features of this phone are fantastic while it may not be encased in a solid block of metal you never feel like your holding a cheap phone the materials are very sturdy and well made especially when one utilizes a case in my opinion being able to access the battery sim microsd in the back of the phone is more useful than it being in a solid metal body the phone itself is incredibly thin i purchased a spigen slim hardcase for the phone because i wanted to keep the phone sleek and thin as designed button placement is very intuitive and easy to get used too hardware this phone is fast all the benchmark tests do not lie this thing performs better than any phone i've had and is faster than my 1st gen samsung galaxy tab i like to get the most out of my phones to the point of unlocking them but even with all of the pre loaded bloat apps this thing still flys great on wifi or lte screen is amazingly clear with great contrast and color buttons are firm and don't feel like they're going to break the speakers are good not great they get the job done for most users watching youtube or listening to music occasionally if you're a hardcore music lover and sound quality is a top priority you may want to look elsewhere touch screen sensitivity is great out of the box i've had no issues ui and software if you've ever used an andriod or samsung device before you'll quickly find yourself comfortable with this phone if you've never used it before it is easy and very enjoyable i always recommend it over ios but i don't have enough experience with windows to sway you from it but the user interface is intuitive and for the most part can be understood by most there are so many customization's from different widgets layouts screens you have so many options to satisfy the most eclectic or ocd personalities camera so many phones have crazy camera features or settings while the average user wont notice or use half of them i will say the picture quality and useful features on this phone can be handy from action shots to selfies to posting your lunch to instragram this phone with suffice for most i always say if you want to really take meaningful pictures buy a dslr size the size of this phone always seems to be the sticky issue with people as i mentioned before if size is the only issue holding you back from this phone just get it 99 of your wont be disappointed and will quickly get used to the phone depending on your size it will be easier than others the average male wouldn't have a problem with it in his pocket for reference i am about 6 foot and average build with larger hands i'm always amazed how often i don't even feel it however for smaller individuals it may be an issue my honest opinion is find one in person i went to bestbuy and the samsung rep allowed me to hold his work note3 i was able to get a real sense of size and feel of it in my pocket and not just attached to a display table i love having a larger screen it just makes it that much easier to use and enjoy and to me outweighs any size inconvenience battery life it's amazing the big size means samsung is able to throw a big battery in it so even though the larger screen uses more power many average users wont have a problem going an entire day on one charge on average i get about a day and a half if i use heavy constant screen on for several hours straight then i'll run the battery down in a day but idle in your pocket with lte on all day you'll have no issues the usb 3 0 charger port is fantastic this thing charges so fast i can get a full charge in half the time as my old htc thunderbolt people complain about the thickness of the cord but its required for the phone to charge that fast safely which brings me to my only issue i've had with this phone my only complaint i had a few issues charging my phone at first i was extremely upset as i thought the port inside my phone was defective essentially with the usb 3 0 cord and charger you get 2 connections in one the standard usb port and an extra smaller port which is why your able to achieve such fast charging and data transfers my issue was that one of the 2 connections on the usb3 wasn't getting a solid contact in my phone this lead to longer charge times and my phone telling me please use the original charger that came with your phone for faster charging i simply bought a new cord on amazon and i haven't had any problems since i recommend to anyone having charging issues to first try another cord as my issue was that the connection to the phone on the cord was slightly bent on the other side its worth noting you can indeed charge this phone with regular phone micro usb cords however it will be slow overall just get this phone i can't state it enough it is really a fantastic phone i fought back and forth whether to get this or the lg g2 for cheaper but i decided i wanted the best phone i could buy at 250 for the best phone on the market that's fairly priced and would last me a long time and more importantly keep me preoccupied and not wanting to buy a new phone before my upgrade,positive
16,as described my first one crashed on its automatic attempt to update the software amazon in their usual pleasant and expedited means shipped a replacement and walked through some manual steps to ensure the new data contract matched he new phone i love the stylus and the apps the size the features this is my 2nd favorite device next to the 12 inch galaxy note tablet when apple quit updating my perfectly operable 1st gen ipad i ran into the arms of android in the time i left android for favor of my ipad they have come so far and surpass ios sadly i feel like ipad and iphones are mere toys in comparison they are great gadgets but the galaxy note line lets someone have fun and get work done i can multitask like a nut on this thing it does all that i need a little device to do,positive
17,works fine minor quirks drop resistant but recommend case on principle great price hesitant to write a review until a couple months had passed in case of product failure but here i go visually the phone was in great condition besides a few spots about 1mm in length in the lower right bezzel where the plastic has been chipped everything came as described and in working condition i was able to pop my sim csrd in and activste it thr same day in the past month i've experienced a few kinks in the os like the touchscreen not responding for a few seconds and ohone froze once but nothing that a restart couldn't fix i dont think that this is a problem with the phone but just a byproduct of its aging 3 year old componants but these things only happened twice in the last month after heavy usage so i'll give it the benefit of the doubt overall getting this phone with its processing power and display was a very good deal for under 200 despite its age it functions are fluid and dont seem to be slowing down at the moment would definately suggest getting a case despite the fact that i've dropped it a few times without one and have yet to get any scratches,positive
18,but looks great otherwise as for the phone itself ordered a used phone in acceptable condition listing said it has a bunch of scratches on it i can honestly say this phone hardly looks used it has some normal wear on the edges but looks great otherwise as for the phone itself i am blown away by how fast and smooth the apps run and by how crisp the pictures look i've been using the cheap prepaid phones for years now and this one blows it out of the water i love the size and the pen feature is great i can't wait to see what else this phone can do,positive
19,love love love love love it this is my first smartphone and i love it the first three days i was like this thing is way to big this isn't going to work after that i got used to it and i can tell you there is no way i can ever go back the camera is fantastic the picture quality on the screen is breathtaking i have watched so many hd videos it does allow for split screen and doing multiwork for example i can split screen and have txt messages on one side and web browser on the other i can also get on the internet and search something while talking on the phone with someone and don't forget the stylus i had some people tell me it was gimmicky but i really like it when making notes and reminders its much easier than typing and i like to use it for alot of games as well since it is more precise than using my finger,positive
20,great phone not so great instructions this is my first purchase of a cell phone from amazon the phone is beautiful and is just what i wanted the price was right and the delivery time was excellent the only issue i had was that i did not know that i needed to call verizon first before it would activate it seems like amazon could mention that step when they sell a new phone even verizon did not mention it in the accompanying paperwork that came with the phone after several unsuccessful attempts to activate the phone which is supposed to be automated i went to the verizon website and found a number i should call prior to letting the phone run the auto setup and activate the phone other than that i am thrilled with my purchase,positive
21,my girl friend wanted a phone that would be better than the generic 40 when i ordered this item it was said to take about two to three weeks to come in to my suprise it took only about 5 days for the item to arive the quality of the product was exactly as posted 9 out of 10 not a single scratch dent or blemish from my evaluation everything has worked perfectly from the time i opened it put of the box and i received exactly why was promised my girl friend wanted a phone that would be better than the generic 40 00 go phone that could be purchased for her carrier and what we got was many folds greater s pen was perfect phone was without a blemish she literally can't stop taken pictures with this phone because samsungs camers rock the only down side that i would have to say is that the battery performance is quite poor but that would be expected if it was the original battery that game with the phone on a older model i plan on buying a battery for a good deal off amazon for this phone in new condition which should fix all off her problems i rated this 5 stars to be nice but in all reality i would give this a 4 out of 5 for the lack of battery porformance thanks for saving me money once again amazon,positive
22,when i got this phone i loved it it was awesome when i got this phone i loved it it was awesome big fast lasted all day great camera great reception then they upgraded my operating system to kitkat and that all changed ok it's still big kitkat turned my phone into a brick i did not move but i could no longer make or receive calls at home just got a network not available message or something like that my data signal was likewise in the toilet battery went to the potty and the worst was the formerly awesome camera became practically useless because now when you tapped the shutter button you had to wait about 3 seconds no exaggeration for the picture to take if you moved the picture was trash this all started immediately following the kitkat update google the problems they're myriad i wouldn't buy another one till the next software update comes out total brick and total waste of my money thanks for nothing verizon or samsung or whoever's fault this is because no matter who you call it's always the other's one fault,positive
23,that's a huuuuuuuge i didn't find the need to buy a smartphone until last december i eschewed them i had been using my dinosaur phone for the last three years it could take abuse like no other it might have required the battery pulled now and then to reset it but it kept doing the job i hired it for making calls i always had a cheap company smartphone or my wife nearby with hers so i didn't get one until i got this one this phone is awesome it's huge screen is perfect for emails surfing the web whatever but that screen size comes with a price this phone is huge people will tease you about it you can always show then how good of pictures it takes and how fast the shutter speed is or any of the plethora of other features you'll like if you get this phone oh yeah the battery lasts forever,positive
24,more than just a smartphone the samsung galaxy note 3 is a powerful personal pocket computer that you can also use as a phone as well i bought this phone a year late and it is still miles beyond most of the phones out there it's fast smooth and the battery life is fantastic if your a doodler like me the s pen in combination with sketchbook for galaxy is top class when it comes to digital art applications i would recommend downloading the google now launcher as opposed to using the standard tocuhwiz that the phone comes with as it is a little clunky and if you have a google account that you use frequently the launcher really makes the experience personalized and it's scary accurate the only downside to this phone is speaker quality without headphones,positive
25,love love love love love this phone having the 32 gb makes a huge difference in the speed i received the phone in a new samsung box with a oem charger cable and plug very easy to use and see yes it's a bit bulky but i bought a bluetooth earbud dabs audio s10 mini wireless headset for 25 prime and it works great the s note feature is wonderful for snapping a picture of your screen and making notes or just to use as a note pad highly recommend,positive
26,my first smart phone i am slow to enter the 21st century this is my first smart phone i only paid a penny and i'm very happy with it it's fairly easy to use my kids love playing with the pen drawing on photos etc the service is great the colors are beautiful i am definitely not an apple fan but i do like siri better than the s voice she works better and all my friends say the voice on my phone is creepy seductive sounding i got my brother to change the voice he's good with technology and it still took him a while but it's better,positive
27,awesome phone 5 stars my husband just purchased this as a replacement for his galaxy nexus he is thrilled with it he loves the multi tasking abilities the vibrant screen and the extra long battery life while at first it seems a lot larger than other phones my husband has adapted to it and wouldn't want the screen to be any smaller the only time that the size is a nuisance is when he tries to carry in his front pocket the phone is extremely fast and efficient he didn't think that he would use the s pen but he loves it and uses it all the time this phone is like having your own personal computer with you at all times there's really nothing that it can't do according to him the i phone is mickey mouse play compared to the note 3,positive
28,beast phone top dog imo best phone out there great for multitasking excellent screen fast lightweight camera takes great pictures in good lighting s pen works great speaker output nice and crisp battery life really good if you turn off some un needed functions like gestures turn off gps when your not needing it turn off auto sync and set screen time out to 30 sec i been getting easy 2 days without charging with light usage like streaming youtube web browsing and some email call quality very good can hear callers loud and sharp on verizon network that is 4g blazing fast on verizon wifi antenna can be a little stronger overall a great phone by samsung,positive
29,amazing phone i love it love my phone i'm using it now only problem is it doesn't come with sim card other than that great quality battery drains a little faster than should but awesome phone charger says connect to original charger when first plugged in but just wiggle a little bit and is fine and charges very fast,positive
30,the best phone our there over the years i've always had great phone's however i must say this is the best phone i have ever owned i had taken four months to research all of the phones out there and am pleased that i settled on the 'samsung galaxy note 3 many of my friends and family tried to talk me out of it stating it was just to big and it certainly does look big on display but once you get it in your hand it fits perfectly now that i own it all of my friends and family want one the look and feel of the phone is amazing the size of the screen is awesome i also love how you can 'hand write your text messages with your stylus pen or you can hand write and have it automatically convert to a block style message or you can still use the keyboard if you like i always hand write my text messages as i've never liked using a keyboard i also love that i can jot down notes with my stylus pen i use this feature a lot for my work the speakers sound great when listening to music the mix of tones is crisp and clean while blending beautifully i use my phone all of the time and the battery life is amazing and especially compared to all of my previous phones i can't say enough good about this phone i've owned it for a month now and still haven't even touched on all of the great features this phone has i hope they come out with a galaxy note 4 in a few years because there is no doubt that will be my next phone thanks amazon your impeccable service is appreciated,positive
31,by far the best phone i have ever used i had the iphone 4s and have to say i did not think it was worth the price this samsung galaxy note 3 however is worth every penny i'm not a techno genius and you don't need to be with this phone the calls are clear the display is vibrant and easy to see love the larger screen it was actually the camera that sold me on this phone but i am digging the s pen and the other gadgets it has while i will admit apple seems to have more apps this android has all the apps that i was using on my iphone all in all i say it is the best phone even though the galaxy s5 has hit the market,positive
32,great phone i was considering to by the sony great phone i was considering to by the sony phone but i needed something cheaper i am very satisfied with it very easy to use and i use many many functions on it the battery life is great too unless i acidentally leave on the wifi or use the gps these deplete my battery much faster the only problem with this phone that it is impossible to change contacts email or texting background dark or black that's a little disturbing but if you can get over this it is a great device,positive
33,great phone advnantages of note 3 outweigh upgrades to note 5 i have quickly come to find the size of the screen to be far superior to my old s3 i would never go back to a smaller phone's screen the note 3 is very detailed colors are vibrant and i see no pixels even when the image is magnified i was a bot reluctant to buy a refurbished phone but breed sent a phone indistinguishable from new also the accessories for an older model are far cheaper than the new note 5 as for the note 5 the lack of a removable battery and sd card were deal breakers for me,positive
34,not as good as expected thought this phone would be much faster but its no faster than my old phone the picture quality is ok just disappointed over all plus the seller sent me the wrong charger so i had to go out and purchase one not a satisfied customer,neutral
35,love love love love love this phone it was cheaper on here then buying it through verizon i received it quickly and was able to quickly and easily get it set up this phone works great i haven't had any major problems with it the only problems i have had are typical phone problems like it freezing up on me but after taking the battery out and turning it back on it is fine again and that hasn't even happened as often as other phones i've had my previous phone was the lg g2 i think the note 3 is a million times better,positive
36,good phone for the money i don't play a whole lot of games or do a whole lot of social media so this is probably more phone than i need i do take a lot of pictures and videos and it is wonderful for that the sound recording on this phone is pretty good i record music and sometimes kick back and video a group when they are doing well the quality is excellent one of the reasons i picked this phone,positive
37,finally something that has my heart this is the best phone i have ever owned finally something that has my heart this is the best phone i have ever owned i carry two and the other is an iphone but hands down this phone does everything and i would never go back to any other kind it is big enough for viewing and i love the touch enlarging battery lasts all day even with steady use i love the way it can be customized to fit your needs tons of emails every day make this note 3 my best choice for a phone no matter what the needs you have,positive
38,nice phone the phone arrived on time and works very well also the phone is in really good cosmetic condition i got it for my husband we will see if it continues to work well i will let you know as we go,positive
39,great phone big screen long battery life and powerful specs what more could you ask for this is the top of the line smart phone right now beware i have had issues with the stock charging cable it is usb 3 0 and is slightly larger that a normal usb 2 0 from most other phones plugging in the 3 0 charger will sometimes work but mostly it doesn't you may have to use an old charger but the battery is so big that it will take you a while to fully charge that way search for usb 3 cable not charging on andriod central to see others with the same problem,positive
40,totally awesome nothing compares to this phone everything else is inferior everything else is too small or too slow the note 3 is the finest device ever made period i can't imagine texting or browsing or watching on something smaller than this now that i've had it for a while the camera takes great pics video very fast i'm also quite happy with verizon so far fast data downloads and much better call clarity service in my area than other carriers i've tried,positive
41,love the phone verizon is another story love love absolutely love this phone i am not crazy about verizon i received my first bill before i had the phone a week higher that i expected i was charged an activation fee of an extra 45 the data really goes fast but i have learned to use wi fi still samsun outdid themselves with this phone it has a glitch thing about touching the icons and the screen jumps to the next page still love the phone though waiting to see when the note 5 comes out,positive
42,cool phone i finally had to break down and purchase a new phone to replace the flip i had been using for about 10 years i chose this because it was highly rated by all the reviews i read and i absolutely refused to be a moronic lemming and purchase an ipos the price through amazon was better than what i could do through verizon and the setup was absolutely painless i am not too thrilled about the 50 increase in my monthly bill but that's what you get for going from a no frills flip phone to a phablet,positive
43,had to return ng for verizon prepaid wish this phone would of worked as the screen quality and size are great sadly verizon says the phone is obsolete and no longer supported,positive
44,very fun item fantastic never had a smartphone before and it's nice to know that it is user friendly very much fun and going to have a heck of a time figuring all the cool things out i especially love the stylus since i hate using my fingers to work on a screen i always feel like my fingers are going to smudge up the screen so the stylus really helps me out with that not tried any of the apps yet but i'm probably going to be doing a lot of exploring on it as i said excellent phone and tons of fun even my husband who is through tracfone was considering on getting one through his provider all my phones have been samsungs from the first phone which i cannot remember the name of to my samsung intensity ii and now my samsung galaxy note 3 i love it,positive
45,it's alright it's an alright solid phone the pen is a great feature for drawing and editing photos though i honestly dont use it all that much its a little wide making it hard to put in a pocket or do one handed this phone is however only slightly bigger than an s5 it has a good processor and is easy to use the call quality however is crap it sounds like your underwater the camera is also poor and i have difficulty getting a sharp image,neutral
46,verizon quit supporting it i wondered why gps took me in circles i went into verizon they said they quit supporting the note 3 i had to get a new phone,positive
47,would buy from again it is exactly as it was described it works perfectly with minor scratches it came with all the necessary items to use for a day to day basis the cell phone company had no issue of making this phone my primiary cell phone,positive
48,its okay does not have as many screens as my original note 3 which has 7 windows this one only has 5,positive
49,nice phone as expected so far so good bought this to replace the samsung note ii when upgrade eligibility came around note 2 screen cracks easily and i suspects that this gorilla glass will break easily too just make sure you have a protective case just in case you drop it functionality is great battery life is exceptional compare to note 2 and droid razor pictures are exquisite compare to the iphone according to several i phone owners that saw my pictures,positive
50,phone works great but i would say the phone was in good phone works great but i would say the phone was in good condition if not a bit lower there are a lot of chips on the chrome trim around the screen the back leather part has a few scratches on the back fading around the camera and looks like fading all in the middle it kind of looks like there is dust all over the back that wont come off i will post pictures in a bit,positive
51,super great price verizon not very interested in settibg it up can't beat price and not even refurbished saved over 400 00 will buy next phone this eay only problem my verizon store was really not very interested in transferring photos and setting it up without them selling it to me main drawback,positive
52,my everyday phone this phone works really great it runs all the latest apps with no freezing or slowdowns the screen is bright and very sharp both the front and rear cameras work well and the flash doubles as a very bright flashlight i've dropped it and sat on it and even dunked it in the swing pool it still works flawlessly,positive
53,just short of perfection phone is everything previous reviews have noted more phone than 90 of folks would ever use one thing that has been a bit of a disappointment has been reception as some have noted this phone for whatever reason on verizon reception is average i am 2000 ft from my cell tower and have yet to see more than 4 mb down on 4g when i am closer to other towers i have seen 39mb down on 4g so i know the product is capable mind you it is possible that this tower is saturated as i never saw more than 13 mb down on mydroid razr maxx voice reception has dropped off as well and at times fades out but returns in the same location never had that issue with the razr here is hoping that software updates resolve some of it other than that amazing device,neutral
54,love my new note 3 love my new note 3 great features one being that i can actually see it i was worried about moving away from my old smart phone with a slide out keyboard as i'm part of the ahem more mature crowd and my eyes fingers aren't what they used to be no problems whatsoever i text like a pro on this,positive
55,kills the iphone 5 i traded to this from the iphone 5 it was the greatest change in my life i love this phone i can go 20 hours easily even more if you leave it in stand bye mode you can leave it for days i just wish it had kitkat for verizon i also wish there was a nice dock for it its awkward because of the usb 3 0 its a different plug and if you use the old 2 0 connection it takes long to charge it,positive
56,could be very dangerous i absolutely loved the phone and would have given it 4 or 5 stars until i made the horrible and could be very dangerous mistake of upgrading the system per the prompts now many times i am unable to connect to the network cannot make calls cannot text in other words the basic things you have a mobile phone for are useless i sure hope i am not out late somewhere and stranded by the side of the road when this happens of course there is no way to undo the upgrade to the operating system i am now stuck with this phone that way too often does not work at all worse yet from what i understand the manufacturer knows this is an issue with this upgrade and yet they are offering no fix no upgrade to this horrible upgrade why i guess they want everyone who made the mistake of approving the prompted upgrade to just buy a new phone maybe a note 4 anyway if they cannot be bothered to fix what could be a dangerous situation out late with no phone service then i will purchase another phone from another manufacturer next time until then because this was so expensive i will just have to hope i am never in a life or death or emergency situation and have no network connection,negative
57,best phone ever i keep learning new things about this phone each time i use it it has replaced all my tv remotes in my house i no longer use my ipad because this can do even more than the ipad can my wife has the iphone 5s and uses my phone every chance she gets the note 3 is so light even with its screen size that it easily disappears in a pocket the only reason to buy the iphone 5s is because you have not tried a note 3 yet,positive
58,i had a samsung note before it was fast and was great for pictures which is the biggest reason i bought the camera slows and out of focus and the whole phone itself seems slow i had a samsung note before it was fast and was great for pictures which is the biggest reason i bought this note if it wasn't for this defect it would have been a perfect 5 stars 3 8 5,positive
59,this is a superb choice for those seeking a new phone and also for those who want a tablet and phone in one device this is an amazing phone phablet it has a super hd screen and also comes with a stylus inside a slot on the phone itself the screen area is very large and the speakers are adequate but headphones are suggested if watching video it has multi screen so that users can have two of certain applications open at the same time and in split screen such as gallery and chrome or maps and gmail it has 3 gbs of ram and is fast a case is needed but not a screen protector as the screen is corning gorilla glass 3 and scratch resistant but not scratch proof if one does not put his or her vehicle keys in the same pocket as the device the screen shouldn't get any scratches i bought a screen protector the same day as when i purchased the phone but have now gone two weeks out of three months' ownership without a single scratch i do highly recommend downloading a home screen launcher such as the one i use called buzz launcher because the programmed home screen is just ugly and cluttered after some experimenting one will discover which applications you can and should turn off to free up ram overall this is a highly rated phone by professional websites and if not mistaken the best selling phone in the world right now for a reason this phone is much better than the galaxy s5 and google nexus 5 another reason i bought this phablet is so i wouldn't also have to spend money on a separate tablet such as the google nexus 7 since this is only 1 3 inches smaller and also has a much better as well as hd screen this is an excellent choice for anyone purchasing a new phone and i highly recommend it and would purchase again,positive
60,phone looks flawless however it will not charge properly phone looks flawless however it will not charge properly even when it says its plunged in and charging the phone off it will not increase inpercentagre of battery life update after reading up on the problem i decided to try another samsung cable and spent 20 at the local store for a new one now the phone charges with no problems,positive
61,works wonderfully it came in nearly brand new no signs of usage at all no discoloration scratches or dents noticeable spen works and started right up the battery life sucks at the moment but i'm also used to an extended battery definitely a little bigger than the lgg3 i have and compared it to but it works and it works beautifully,positive
62,awesome i'm an apple guy but also travel a lot when i saw this i tried it and am a convert with a portable keyboard it's all i need when i travel overseas i won't take my macbook or my ipad on the next trip this note 3 will do it all and it's awesome i love it and will be giving my iphone to my daughter shortly it's a trade up for me i highly recommend it,positive
63,this is a great device i replaced a samsung galaxy s3 with this is a great device i replaced a samsung galaxy s3 with this phone and have no regrets as a prolific tablet pc pen user having a pen for my phone takes me back to my palm days this has eliminated all of the little post it notes and information scribbled on the back of business cards that littered my desk and car my only issue is the lack of standard non bulky cases for this phone,positive
64,awesome phone probably the most powerful capable phones of all on the market especially good is that you can open more than one app at a time and that it links to accessories like watches battery life is long and the display large and bright i and others i know have replaced tablets with the note 3 it is a real workhorse,positive
65,very nice capabilities and very future proof finally after years of waiting a phone with practically everything that i want and need seems to be here i've had this phone for over 2 months and it has a large and high quality display yet easy to hold in one hand powerful future proof long battery life good sound quality and clarity on both speakers infrared tv remote good camera usb 3 0 speeds support for latest wireless standards and optional sd card i hope bug performance fixes get released in a timely manner unlike with my verizon gnexus might need to be patient and give the phone a few days i got a replacement and for the 1st 3 or 4 charges the battery would drain easily to 50 after 9 hours of usage and i was not even using the same amount of features as with the 1st phone nor even using it as much but it improved over time the 1st phone did not have this issue and right out of the box would have only dropped to 80 after the same usage and only dropped 2 or 3 overnight instead of 4 to 6 like with the current one positives battery life charge times screen size sound quality of both speakers so nice not to hear chipmunks anymore signal quality wifi and lte camera quality in decent lighting phone stays cool during heavy usage gaming phone calls etc overall keyboard layout negatives intermittent unexplained battery drainage maybe nsa is spying on me auto corrections on native keyboard the way that the phone and contacts features work should be simpler to use with a screen this size but requires 2 hands or might be more suited to left handed people with large hands intermittent touchwiz feature malfunctions s voice gestures 1 handed mode etc inability to remember audio settings for head set and constant prompts about volume safety i only use audio jack while in the car connected to a cassette adapter not earphones since i don't have bluetooth or any native support for smart phones in my car some notes touchwiz adds much needed functionality to native android that is nice but i ve turned off a lot of the features because some were overkill for my needs and too unreliable for every day use i only have prior experience with native android and cyanogenmod and although i prefer touchwiz over native android it still needs some serious work for instance i find that the swipe to the left or right to message or call a contact works intermittently along with some of the other advertised features such as smart stay s voice hand gestures etc so i ve turned most of them off and only enable some while using hands free mode while driving or at home it is also more difficult to do some of the most basic of tasks using touchwiz battery life and charge times with stock charger is very nice although at times since i got my replacement note 3 it seems like something drains the battery much faster than with the 1st one going to eventually reset phone to see if it is some kind of os malfunction with normal drainage i can usually go for 2 or 3 days on a single charge with what i consider moderate usage hangouts chatting phone calls iheartradio gaming and watching videos considering that i have a larger screen than i had before use more of the phone s features and for longer periods of time while running touchwiz i m impressed the battery is not even 2x the capacity of my gnexus which would have required 2 charges daily with the same kind of usage on native android or cyanogenmod the screen is fantastic and i ve enjoyed watching both 1080p and 720p videos without problems native player can handle most video formats but does not have the same support for audio encoding phone feels light weight and although it is aesthetically pleasing to look at the materials feel kind of cheap so i ve invested in a cheap case to prolong the aesthetics things that i don t like i currently know 2 other people who ve bought this phone and 1 of them along with myself had to get replacements my 1st one had issues with usb3 0 connectivity a faulty charging cable strange tapping sound during phone calls and a few other bugs the other party had issues with the charging port not sure if the 3rd person had issues my friend that always buys samsung phones says that the issues with charging ports are common but this is only my 2nd samsung phone so i cannot say for sure if this is the case auto correct and word suggestions on native keyboard are a pain to use and so unnatural i m used to pressing the back key to have my words reset to what i initially typed in the event that auto correct is not needed but with this keyboard you are sometimes presented with a undo button and sometimes you just have to get creative and use the sym button or write with the stylus pen to bypass the auto corrections this is a major flaw in my opinion and should have been fixed by now considering that several updates have been released for the apps and the phone itself should not take so much effort to type on a touch screen phone hopefully apple hasn't patented this feature as with my galaxy nexus the auto screen brightness is too dim for standard use not sure how well it would prolong battery life for those who walk around a lot while using their phones stylus is hard to remove good that it won t fall out on accident though surprisingly it has not damaged any of my nails interestingly my protection case makes removing the stylus very easy you go cimo s line case in order to use usb 3 0 it has to switch to airplane mode transfers don t last very long at these speeds anyway and it has a built in feature to turn back on usb 2 0 mode if 5 minutes go by and usb 3 0 is not being used this feature can also be problematic if you try to let windows convert a video file to be transferred to the phone which would take more than 5 minutes wall charger has usb port on the side of the wall unit which too me is an invite for bent prongs considering that it is recommended that you remove it to save power and it wastes a port on a lot of surge suppressors,positive
66,great phone and company first product that arrived had a bad battery and would not stay on without restarting randomly company was wonderful and sent me a replacement very quickly they included everything i needed to send the broken phone back,positive
67,works great i've had this thing for a couple years now still going strong after several drops with a case on and being left in the rain the note 3 is my favorite phone this is my second one i will probably continue to get them after this one dies remember getting a brand new phone everytime one comes out is not environmentally friendly,positive
68,this is a great phone and good price this is a great phone and good price the stylus could be a bit more sensitive but i think that's on samsung's end hope it lasts at least as long as my note 2 did i did download a different note program because the layout changed from note 2,positive
69,love love love this phone i adore this phone so much i'm contemplating selling my 7 samsung galaxy tab and just using this it does absolutely everything i need it to do including casual game playing and reading books which is why i bought the tablet in the first place the screen is large enough and the adjustments easy enough to find can't imagine using anything else,positive
70,best phone on the market researched all of the newest flagship phones on the market and have found this is by far the most capable phone for my network its a cdma phone and uses a sim card the phone is not too big as some may think fits perfectly in any pocket and does not feel bulky still very lightweight and the s pen is very handy for snapchat and other drawing and note taking apps very responsivea and no lag with proccessor even with multiple apps running andriod 4 3 hopefully 4 4 coming soon way more versatile than ios run emulators with great graphics and connects with my chromcast no problem s beam is super easy to use and i have connected my nx300 to this for storage and viewfinder for the camara very happy with purchase and is the best for cdma networks at the moment,positive
71,no cell phone charger included looks almost new arrived on time however no cell phone charger came with the box all of the cell phones i reviewed had a cell phone charger included so i thought it was general practice to include this with the cell phone,neutral

75,extremely happy with this decision without getting all technical if you don't need the latest greatest s6 s6 edge note4 this thing is a powerhouse unto itself i am very happy with my decision and for the price 20 with 2yr contract how could i not be,positive
76,love this phone love this phone even if it's a little over a year old it's still such an improvement over my note 2 the only problem i have with it is that sometimes after getting a push notification the screen doesn't time out i'm sure this can be fixed through the settings but i haven't been able to figure out how yet,positive
77,love it i have used many apple and android products this is the first phone i can say that i loved yes the screen is huge but that's a good thing it does fit in your pocket it fits everywhere my last phone did battery is good but not amazing i usually get a day and a half out of it but i have killed in less than a day by playing games browsing for 4 hours,positive
78,best phone ever this phone is the best phone i have ever had the amount of processing speed this thing has is incredible also the design is awesome it is slim and if you have big hands fits right in small hands you will likely have to go two hand like i do i also have a defender series otterbox on it and it still fits in my pocket but beware when you get this phone your friend may say things like nice tv you got there so as long as you have tough skin and good friends this is definatly the phone for you,positive
79,so far this has been a great phone purchased used on amazon so far this has been a great phone purchased used on amazon i've had it for about 5 months and i really like it i hate to pay retail for anything so this is great it is working smoothly on a 3rd party verizon network i will probably buy my next phone the same way,positive

85,big phone with all the bells and whistles this is a great phone i wished i would have ordered two of them i have the galaxy s5 and love it but am a little jealous of that my hubby has this one it is going to take a bit to learn to use all the tools it has but so far he has no complainants and so neither do i,positive
86,it is fast and fun the galaxy note phones are excellent for anyone todate my favorit phone ever yes it is a bit larger at 5 7 inches it is fast and fun the galaxy note phones are excellent for anyone wanting to use less paper i use mine note 3 to take notes and make todo lists annotate pictures or pdfs i just love it,positive
87,this phone is great it's nice enough to where you don't think this phone is great it's nice enough to where you don't think of it as an old phone and the stylus is pretty cool too the bigger screen really makes using the phone easier and honestly more likable surprisingly good battery life,positive
88,awesome phone and seller great seller product as listed love my phone packaged great,positive
89,ok ok,positive
90,take a note way better than my old lg g2 if you use your phone a lot like i do then it wouldn't hurt to invest in a couple of extra batteries other then that phone is great no lagging no crashing of any kind,positive

92,sd card did not function i went through a lot of extra trouble to get a refurbished new note 3 huge fan of the phone but i'm giving a 3 because for a refurbished phone it won't even read a micro sd card at all its missing a pin connecter,neutral
93,best phone on the market i have owned a lot of androids and this one is by far my favorite no problems with apps crashing or conflicting the battery life is amazing and lasts all day even if i play music and games i never really use the stylus but that's just me plus the deal i got on this through amazon was the best one out there i thought the price was a typo at first,positive
94,amazing phone so many things i love about this size is definitely important no matter what your wife tells you lol other than the size it has lots of very cool and useful things most of which i may never use but for example you can scroll thru things you are reading by simply tilting your head up or down,positive
95,this is the best phone ever the samsung galaxy note 3 on verizon wireless picks up right where its predecessor left off making key upgrades to the design and display while adding a bevy of new stylus features add in the powerful processor and superb multitasking chops and the note 3 easily wins our my award for phablets on verizon,positive
96,samsung galaxy refurbed perfect just what i needed,positive
97,good phone with flaw with chargin cable my wife used this phone for about one year and she started having issues with charging correctly she first noticed that the phone did not charge overnight and later found out that the phone only charges when the charging cable is plugged in at a certain angle we first thought it was the phone terminal issue but when we got the replacement phone from verizon it had the same issue we called verizon and they transferred me over to samsung because they have known issue with the early versions of charging cable long story short samsung is willing to repair the cable and i will be without the cable for at least a week they had no other options but to send in the cable and wait4 5 days they are basically letting the loyal consumers suffer for their fault of manufacturing poor cables this is not what i expected from a well known brand of samsung disappointed service,neutral
98,i love this phone great screen resolution takes excellent photos most of all i love it because it is larger and i can read the screen without glasses the only downside is it won't fit in all pockets so i bought an otterbox case so i can through it in my purse i am sure it would fit in men's pant pockets,positive
99,awesome own for 19 months and love this phone works everywhere with verizon service have had no problem just finally filled up and now i need an sd card for storage of pics and videos not hard to hold due to size actually very comfortable great features,positive

151,amazon wireless and vzw to preface the entire review i was researching this device with vzw for over 2 months amazon has always had the lowest price verizon couldn't even come close to matching it the process was tedious for me because i was adding my line to a family plan and did not have the account holders driver license number and some other information when trying to go through the process vzw customer service verified who i was and had the ability to make changes on the account but would not tell me the information i needed luckily the amazon rep was on the phone with me and was able to help facilitate what i needed while i was on the phone with vzw at two separate points they tried to steal the sale from amazon but could only offer discounts in accessories which amazon was still beating their discounted pricing after finally receiving my phone two days later i tried activating my device i spent over 4 hours on the phone with different vzw reps to help activate the device no one could help me i guess what happened was someone at verizon had my order set to be activated the following day but they ported my number from sprint already i was without service for almost 1 whole day the following day was thanksgiving when i needed to activate it but vzw's support number was closed due to the holiday luckily i was able to connect with someone at amazon who had a direct contact number who was able to force my activation and get my phone up and running if it wasnt for amazon i would have been down an entire two plus days without a phone after buying the device at 199 99 on nov 26 i found the device price was lowered i called amazon and since it was within 30 days of purchase they are refunding me the 50 difference which increased the monetary value for amazon wireless even further the only down side besides hours on the phone trying to activate was the fact that although i ordered the protection plan through vzw when ordering with amazon verizon had no record of that as long as it is within the first 30 days you can call vzw to add it i had read a previous review that said that which made me double check a week later after activation all in all i had a lot of hiccups with the process but the amazon wireless customer service made right by everything i went though and was a pleasure to work with and well deserving of my business i will definitely go through amazon for my next mobile purchase,neutral

196,absolutely crushes the iphone in every aspect this phone is an amazing phone tablet toy tool it performs very well at each purpose that i bought it for i have had it for about 3 months now and have never regretted it the large screen is very clear and very vivid watching videos editing photos and surfing the web are very easy with this screen they camera is the best i have used on a mobile device and is the envy of my iphone loving wife the pictures are very clear and detailed and it is very easy to use i think it serves a very good purpose for replacing a tablet and smartphone with one device the quality is great if you are one of the kool aid drinking apple fans this can be the salvation to your addiction iphones are puny junk when compared to this thing the removable storage is one of the many features that apple refuses to allow in the iphones and which i absolutely require in all of my devices the only drawback is the lack of accessories this in my opinion is a compliment to the fact that it is a tool and not a gadget to be used by self obsessed do nothing hipsters living off mommy's money it is a device for working multitasking living people that want to enjoy their phone and not sit around waiting to waste their money on the next upgrade,positive

205,two stars lcd screen went out after only a month,neutral
206,amazing phone but skip to bottom summary if you do not have time to read this let me start off by saying i am in love with this phone i have owned it for 3 months now and can't seem to put it down it is big enough where i do not have to squint to read emails such as on the iphone and small enough where i can text and type one handed i have bigger hands the features that come packed with this phone are all very useful and great there are honestly more features than anyone would need to use but more is always better it is very fast and doesn't seem to skip a beat with all my programs running in the background as well as astounding battery life that lets me go without a charge for a minimum of 2 days i have not had the mentioned reception issues so it may just be a bad batch of phones or the service in my area is very good now i bet you're wondering why i am only giving this product 2 stars when i have just talked so highly of this product the poor rating is for amazon customer service and their bloatware i had initially purchased the phone and chosen an address for it to be shipped to an hour after purchasing i recognized a different address was designated for shipping i contacted amazon an hour after the purchase 3 days before it shipped and told them the correct address for shipping i was told the problem was addressed but behold my product was shipped to the other address and i did not receive my product in time or at the correct location not to mention the product came a day late once i received my phone i was willing to let the shipping mistake slide until i started looking through the programs and realized i could not delete any of the apps that amazon preloaded onto the device granted they are not very high in memory usage but when i spend 200 of my hard earned money on a good product i would like to have the option of choosing which apps i need and don't need to put it in perspective it is like buying a car and not having the option of choosing which features you want and don't want the only thing you can do is disable the apps so they dont run in the background but they still take up memory that should be free the phone does come with other preloaded apps samsung google that cannot be removed but they are at least desirable and used every day i actually considered returning this phone due to the unnecessary bloatware and inability of removal but decided that the product is too good to let a couple apps ruin its integrity a company should not jam their products down a customer's throat and expect positive feedback quite actually it deters me from using your apps on any of my devices summary phone is a great product much better than the iphone 4s i switched from amazon shipping disappointed me and sent phone to wrong address amazon pre loads their permanent bloatware apps onto the phone cannot be removed my recommendation is to purchase this phone from your cellular carrier as it will come preloaded with less bloatware apps,neutral
207,good product wrong battery overall the product was good the only bad thing about the phone is that it came with the wrong battery i would have given it 5 stars if it weren't for that so i ended up having to purchase a battery for it which meant i had to wait another week or so to get it,neutral

231,great phone ridiculously great screen but has keyboard annoyances that motorola does not this phone is pure awesome end of story lightning fast full 1080p screen which is mind blowingly clear this phone has a lot going for it however motorola has samsung crushed when it comes to user friendliness regarding typing let's face it everyone gets annoyed now and again with auto correct but at least motorola's auto correct is intuitive and understands when it changes staind to stained and you go back to change it back to staind because it's actually what you meant motorola understands ok you really meant to spell it that way we'll let it go samsung corrects you again and even better on a motorola droid when you hit backspace after an auto correct it changes stained back to staind because it realizes you actually meant it that way and again on a motorola when you hit sym to get your comma then you hit comma when you hit the spacebar to go to the next word the keyboard changes back from symbols to letters for you on samsung you have to hit sym again to return to the qwerty keyboard minor things i know but it's very surprising samsung gets these things wrong i'd think by now they would've had time to realize these inconveniences in their keyboard programming and fix them for us maybe someday regardless the phone is a true power house of performance handling every multi tasking thing you can throw at it without skipping a beat and still begging for more,positive

461,bad item when i bought work fine but 15 days stopped working you're going to waste your money the only good thing is that amazon helped me get my money back,neutral
462,bought for a good price bought for great price as a new verizon customer i learn three days later could have gotten it 20 cheaper also could have gotten a s4 instead s3 for same price all good things come to those who wait over all i am still happy,positive
463,not really what i thought it would be i was hoping for so much more i upgraded from the galaxy nexus to the note 3 in hopes of having a more productive phone the only reason to buy the note 3 is the stylus and ability to write notes otherwise it's no different than any phone except much bitter while the device does a good job with transcribing my chicken scratch i find it hard to write small enough to fit an email address or other notes the biggest annoyance i have is that some of the features that made this phone device to desirable just aren't that good mainly the split screen apps the system locks out most of the apps and only allows a small handful of apps to be use you have no control over the apps so if you want to watch slingbox or hbo go while texting or sending emails you cannot do it additionally the buttons are a bit different than what i am use to my favorite button was the window selector that allows you to switch apps doesn't exist on the note 3 you have to hold the home button for a couple seconds i find this very annoying this device has a lot of promise but samsung did a horrible job of allowing people to actually use the device i wish i could have got the s4 or something else i would have no problem trading away the bonus features of the note 3,neutral
464,best phone i've ever owned a great phone with tons of functions i've owned apple and htc products and the note 3 blows them all away,positive
465,don't buy phones through amazon received a previously opened product there was dust on the phone underneath the packaging which scratched the screen and the earbuds were missing battery life seemed poor but that might have been because it had been used and repackaged i had a lengthier review but the powers that be didn't want you to see it,negative

469,huge waste of money so upset this was a really terrible phone and after 1 5 yrs of suffering with it i finally switched back to my old iphone 4s and felt like i performed a major upgrade i am appalled at a large company like samsung for even releasing such a thing onto the market and the fact that this is a third generation product is completely shameful the device hardly functions as a phone even and it overheats insanely which also burns its own batteries so it doesn't last even half a day frankly if i had energy i would have claimed an ftc complaint or something because i bought a device for a lot of money thinking that it would be a phone and also a capable mobile computing device and instead received a heavy brick that gets no reception and has no battery to make calls and tries to scorch my skin through the pant pocket seriously this makes me wonder if there is a single samsung engineer that actually tried this product,negative

471,great phone but no sim card when buying this phone it does not tell you that you need a sim card so when i received it i could not use it because no sim card the order shows a sim so why no card,positive
472,could only be better if someone other than samsung made it i love the phone it has worked superbly for me i came from a much simpler phone so getting used to all of the options was a bit challenging but very fun at the same time there are two things i'd like to talk about with this phone size and samsung's customer service size i can never go back to a smaller screen i really don't care that sometimes it is tough to reach some of the letters when texting or that i almost drop it sometimes when i don't have a good grip on it i love having so much screen real estate i love it and i will never go back in general though i don't have much trouble texting on it or using it one handed even without enabling the special one handed use feature i'm 6'2 so i'm somewhat taller than average so it may be that i'm just large enough for the size to be a good fit samsung's customer service terrible i don't think they really get how it's supposed to be done i don't think they really understand how to please customers the right way that's probably why they have so many useless features all piled on the phone get rid of some of them and make others just plain work better anyway it started with my phone arriving i opened the box and got right into everything then noticed that there wasn't an included headset i just thought wow are they really that cheap that they can't even include a headset that probably costs them 1 to make with their most expensive phone so i contacted customer service to see if there was any way i could get one i had sold my pair of beats headphones since i don't listen to music as much anymore and had been thinking i'd use the stock headset that i thought would come with it i basically got a flat no my next aggravation came when i saw a news article that said free 50 google play credit for note 3 customers i quickly made my way to the link provided only to be met with a screen that said due to the high demand we have run out of our supply of credits thank you for your interest the promotion was supposed to run for 2 months and instead lasted less than 2 weeks really samsung i contacted customer service again to see if there was any way a disgruntled customer could get in on those free credits again a flat no these are somewhat little things but it's the little things that make good customer service and i feel like samsung fails miserably in that department,positive

474,you cant go wrong with the note 3 best phone ever,positive
475,most amazing cell phone ever i have always thought the note was an interesting concept since the first version i love my iphone but with each release i became more and more disappointed that they never increase the screen size i was worried about moving from my apple iphones but it was time i had to try i have been absolutely amazed by this phone the size of the screen is terrific the first few days it felt huge and took some getting used to but by day 3 it was normal and no big deal i look at my iphone and think wow i settled for that tiny screen i figured with this big screen i would have to run from outlet to outlet with a charger but it lasts all day where my iphone couldn't the speed the image quality and the functionality of this phone is just amazing the s pen features and samsung's spin on the android platform are perfect the s pen allows for such accuracy on the screen that you can do very detailed work on a relatively small screen it's integration with evernote is great and the sketchbook allows the average artist an excellent canvas in his or her pocket with adobe illustrator like features the keyboard has a top row of numbers making input of passwords and data so much faster they not only improved the speed of a smartphone they improved the speed that a user and work with it making my ipad and iphone obsolete i was able to transfer my music with little effort thanks to the google play music app including the things i purchased i used the note app to sync notes on my apple devices the integration between the note 3 and evernote offer a solution to this the only negative i can say about the phone is s voice is no siri i used the location based reminders on the iphone often for things such as remind me when i get home to take out the trash i have yet to get s voice to do this but i understand it's supposed to be able to i'm almost speechless at how perfect this phone is if you are interested in a bigger screen are worried about leaving the iphone dont be give this phone a few days to get used to and you wont look back,positive
476,five stars awesome,positive
477,don't buy this wonderful phone here i want to start by saying note 3 is actually a wonderful phone however the one i got from amazon with verizon was not i purchased the phone from amazon wireless with verizon because they were having a really good deal for this phone however it turned out to be a disaster i first heard a static noise from time to time when i was on the phone and then the fully charged battery died within 12 hours on power saving mode i don't use my phone a lot usually my iphone 4 can last me over 2 days so at first i thought switching to samsung from apple was a huge mistake then i searched online everybody online says that the samsung note 3 is supposed to have a really good battery actually pretty much the best in the market so with all these problems i returned the phone to amazon and went to a local at t store and bought the same phone it turns out that the phone's battery is really good now my note 3 also lasts me at least 2 days without being on the power saving mode i am not sure if all phones from verizon are of such poor quality or amazon wireless has bad phones or i'm just unlucky but at least amazon's return service is good so if you get a bad phone as i did you can at least send it back,positive
478,the worst i hate this phone,negative
479,i'm loving it this is my second samsung phone after galaxy nexus and i can already say that i won't be moving away from samsung phones in the near future as an fyi my smartphone usage history comprises of htc kaiser at t tilt blackberry 8700 iphone 3g htc evo 4g htc evo 3d samsung galaxy nexus lg optimus g and now this samsung galaxy note 3 you can probably find more than one million reviews for this phone online hence i'll not include any of that readily available info in this review following is my feedback of the black galaxy note 3 verizon version not cdma before getting this phone i was under the impression that all verizon phones are sim less cdma but i was wrong all verizon feature phones are cdma all verizon smart phones use a sim card also if you buy this phone online chances are that the sim card will already be installed inside this device so do not spend too much time looking inside the box vacuuming your living room yelling at your spouse and then searching the parking lot look inside the device first google voice does not work this is not related to this phone as much as to verizon verizon does not allow google voice and hence if you are a current google voice user to make international calls make other plans you will not be able to continue using google voice to make international calls once you get this phone screen resists fingerprints while i could not find anything online that mentions that the screen is oleophobic i very much suspect so this screen resists fingerprints to a large extent may be it was a requirement for the s pen stylus may be not either way i'm not complaining call quality rocks both local as well as international calls are crystal clear screen auto brightness works i have used smartphones before which had their auto brightness feature set to either too aggressive or not aggressive enough this phone gets it just right i never have to worry about not being able to read it in sunlight or get blinded by the screen at 3am home button is not clicky enough i mean it works but does not feel as clicky as the iphone one handed mode features like these differentiate this phone from other phablets i'm surprised at how much i use the one handed mode while driving or hauling groceries or sex and stuff touchwiz everyone knows that touchwiz is not the prettiest ui layer on android but it does add features that do not exist natively in android rather than providing 16 weather widgets and 24 clock widgets samsung has focused more on including features like raising your phone to your ear to answer a call one touch status bar swipe right to call swipe left to text incoming call notification window when screen is on smart stay hand gestures and stuff my magazine this feature does offer the promise of a good native rss reader but the lack of customization in adding your own feeds makes this less useful as of now i hope they make it more customizable in future updates battery lasts more than enough with moderate usage i have not had to charge my phone before bedtime so far in fact the lowest i managed to drive down the battery was 25 on a day that involved shooting videos using 4k smooth motion slow motions and stuff handwriting recognition works every time you have the s pen out you get the option of writing instead of typing the text in most text fields i would say that this works about 90 of the time and it even identifies cursive disable apps if you do not like pre installed apps from verizon or samsung that you can not uninstall this phone offers you the next best thing you can simply disable any app in the settings and then you don't have to worry about those disabled apps running in the background or using your location data and stuff good build quality as a side note i'd also like to mention that my almost 2 year old galaxy nexus is still rocking even after getting abused at the hands of my 3 year old multiple times while my less than one year old lg optimus g did not survive i'm confident that this phone will be equally strong and durable also in spite of being such a large device it is surprisingly easy to hold while my lg optimus g was very slippery this is more grippy photos auto move to sd card if you insert a micro sd card the phone starts saving all the photos videos to it automatically and you can change this in settings if you like this is a convenient and well thought feature i'm loving my samsung galaxy note 3 black verizon wireless hope this helps update nov 6 2013 google voice started to work on this phone not sure what changed may be google updated their app in some way but yay another strike in the pros column update jan 2 2014 so i have had some more time with this phone and i explored its built in rf transmitter remote functionality and it works fine i'm probably in the minority here when i say that all my tv cable box and sound bar are manufactured by samsung but my note 3 has no trouble controlling any one of them plus the samsung watchon app is cool for browsing whats on tv currently across various channels and if you like something just tap the watch on tv button and voila also i'm able to control my samsung tv and cable box thru my sony tablet so i would assume that this phone should not have much trouble controlling non samsung branded devices,positive

481,best cell phone on the planet forget those silly complaints about region lock they do not affect 99 99 of users and no usa carriers the n9000 is the european phone and gets setup for the carrier used in the european country where you activate the phone period us users need to get the phone for their respective carrier which changes the last digit of the number it's that simple amazon makes both available i teach overseas yearly i keep my phone in airplane mode and use wi fi or get a cheap phone card first i am not affiliated with samsung in any way nor do i work for a cell phone store i am a writer though secondly i hate long reviews with the poster just reports the specs you already have rather these comments show why the galaxy note 3 is more technologically advanced and more phone for your money compared to the many good phones on the market today as for those phones that only show an app screen i call them cave phones 1 the beautiful 5 7 super amoled hd display has a wow factor everything is crisp and clear with a resolution of 1920 x 1080p 386 ppi despite a few good contenders no phone on the market can match the combination of vibrant color and deep blacks check it out for yourself for those who prefer drab you can even adjust color intensity and contrast is this practical you bet you get more viewable data for all social networking apps you can see more email and contacts without scrolling browsing is quick and pages more visible youtubes and video are fantastic games are more playable you can see larger areas on gps maps you get a better view of radar in weather live wallpapers look great you can use it as a reader you can multitask with it and with the right productivity apps you can even get some work done on it i will never go back to a small screen phone this phone is a joy to use 2 the cpu for us versions is the quad core qualcomm snapdragon 800 2 3 which is the fastest processor on the planet as of this time it will perform well for years to come a few other phones have it no lag on this baby just try to do things to outpace it it moves data faster than you can see partially because of 3 3 the adreno 330 gpu is the best on the market a few other phones have it graphics are amazing it is 50 faster than the adreno 320 in the galaxy s4 which is a screamer 4 it's the only phone to come with 3 gb of ddr 3 ram it also comes standard with 32 gigs of storage and you can add more with an sd card note no extra charges for these 5 it has a great 13 megapixel camera with useful software a bsi sensor smart digital stabilization and high cri led very few phones have this it is also the only phone to do 4k video right now sharp it also does 1080p video at 60 fps which is great 6 no other phone has usb 3 0 2 advantages the phone charges very quickly on the 2 amp charger and nice thick cable file transfer times are faster with usb 3 0 a 2 gig file takes 27 seconds from the note 3 to my high end pc with usb 2 0 the same file takes 57 seconds 7 how many phones have an s pen except for email and quick notes i seldom used the s pen on my original galaxy note but the note 3 comes with some useful software making it more functional and the handwriting recognition is scary accurate 8 how many phones have a huge 3200 ma battery it easily lasts all day with moderate to heavy use despite the large screen hardware cpu and gpu improvements as well as android 4 3 make the 100 ma bump over the note 2 even more significant you can also open the back and change out the battery unlike some phones 9 it does infrared remote control it also has tv out via mhl a v link accelerometer gyro proximity compass barometer temperature humidity and gesture sensor i'm serious people you get more for your money 10 hello multitasking the fast cpu gpu extra memory and high resolution 5 7 inch screen make multitasking feasible and fun on a cell phone you can even scroll through multiple applications in each split screen this is even better if you hook up a keyboard and mouse via bluetooth or usb and connect through hdmi to your tv or computer monitor the note 3 can actually serve as a small computer how many phones can do that you can also mirror the phone screen with your smart tv for internet games viewing pics whatever 11 this the best cell phone for gaming on the market period the above features and opengl 3 0 which is part of android 4 3 make it happen don't believe me read the reviews watch the you tubes and compared it for yourself 12 it doesn't just have gps it also uses a gps improved and glonass satellites dl a gps satellite app and you'll see it will access between 5 and 25 satellites at once depending on time of day and location 13 got knox no you don't this phone provides business enterprise and government level security for boot vpn etc and comes in handy for privacy on public wi fi you don't have to use it but it is there 14 the air command and air gesture features make the phone futuristic how many phones do that 15 is the screen too large for one handed operation yes but so what the tradeoff is worth it besides samsung now includes software to shrink it for one handed so you get the best of both worlds 16 i have been using the original galaxy note which is actually wider wearing suit pants to jeans both phones fit fine in your pocket don't worry about it unless you wear skinny jeans 17 the touchwiz ui is fine and superfast now but i prefer a 3rd party launcher go launcher ex from the play store over a million users so the launcher is not a deciding factor in phone purchase for any android manufacturer there are a few things that samsung needs to improve in my opinion i don't know how many thousands of people need to tell them that putting the volume rockers directly opposite the power button is inconvenient for users the note 2 placement was better but still wrong i do like the new speaker placement though its perfect for horizontal viewing because your hand channels the sound to the user however there should be two of them or a better one it is ok just not great like the rest of the phone this phone should also be waterproof right out of the box not a scaled down version just waterproof the thing other manufacturers are doing it for their flagship phones that means samsung can do it too truth be known we users never want to see another flagship phone that is not waterproof it's doable so please do it smoke it with that nano whatever waterproofing stuff you went to ces all that said i'm very happy with the note 3 imho the note 3 is so powerful and functional it is the first device i would classify as a hand held computer as a professor i researched it for days and used the original galaxy note for over a year now there are other good phones but the note 3 does it in one package and in most cases does it better for the same flag ship phone price i feel sorry for the fanboys and people believing advertising hype who don't research the market they pay top dollar but don't get their money's worth amazon is a great place to get your money's worth and to find out user information thanks amazon oh yeah almost forgot to mention it's a really good phone too recommendation get a case for any phone one that raises a bevel on the front glass and try to find a good screen protector,positive
482,maybe you can live with it i couldn't i was excited to have this shiny new phablet until i started to use it i am new to samsung so i figured the ui would take a little getting used to i was right the interface is very different from motorola or htc i think of myself as tech savvy but the phone had little logic in the design of the menu's or locations for any of it's 80 important settings the camera rocks at 13mp with crystal clear pictures as long as you use the flash the s pen working on the back and list buttons was very nice but palming the pen to push the home button is tedious the display is stunning and the adapt features on both the sound for headphones and visuals are great speaking of sound if you like listening to music or watching videos i suggest you pick up a decent pair of headphones with your order the speaker is terrible its distorted and very sharp on c and s sounds while loud it lacks clarity in its volume additionally the microphone is trash i've had some one talk to me using my phone and the distortion is present here as well if you talk on speaker a lot as i do this probably isn't for you it like every other phone i've purchased in the last 2 years comes pre installed with a ton of instant disable apps i would love to get the choice of what i want to store on my phone for a change it also functions poorly with the youtube and spotify apps i run aside from this there is also the voice activation it turned on at its choice of awkward moments calling and texting without my knowledge this more than any other reason lead me to the decision to send it back and choose a different phone i'm going to miss the s pen and scrapbook but i think i can get over it the samsung galaxy note 3 might be a great phone for some but not for me i wouldn't recommend it but i won't say it was a bad phone i like where they're going with this line but i'm going to stay away until they work out all those bugs good luck and happy shopping,positive
483,i love this phone i have had this phone for about one month now i got it directly from verizon not through amazon and i just love it it is my first smartphone and i will admit i was a little nervous going from a basic flip phone to any smartphone let alone one as large and robust as i heard this one was my main reasons for choosing this phone over others were 1 i really wanted a tablet but i wanted one that would fit in my purse if it would work as a phone too great 2 i'd done a lot of research on styluses and most of them seemed kind of large for any type of writing they seem to be about the size of a pencil eraser and while there are some small pencil erasers on certain mechanical pens i was looking for a finer point so the s pen really intrigued me i also liked the fact that it is stored inside the phone when looking at others i was worried i'd end up losing any stylus i bought that i couldn't attach to the phone in some way i was absolutely right on both counts especially the s pen i honestly cannot imagine a smartphone without something like this i use the s pen all the time it's like having a small notepad in my hand when i want to do any writing text messages note taking etc i don't have to try to use my fingers on hovering keys i can write everything by hand although occasionally the phone doesn't get the word right most of the time it does there was no extended handwriting training like what i remember from trying out speech recognition software you can also get other languages activated for free i tried the russian out and it was just wonderful to see it turn my admittedly poor handwriting into recognizable words also because the s pen has such a fine point it has excellent precision for tapping on apps and checking checkboxes anything you might want to do on the phone i often even use it to write out digits in my tip calculator app rather than trying to use the number keypad that shows up on the screen and although this isn't mentioned anywhere the s pen has a very nice feel to it though i suppose people with big hands might find it to be too skinny i have tiny hands and the phone as a whole is just perfect for me it probably helps that i look at it more as a tiny tablet that can make calls and less as a phone not having had a smaller smartphone before probably helps too especially since i did occasionally use my parents' ipad now i'll admit i belong to the paper generation there are just some things i do better on paper than on a computer and having the ability to write out my thoughts on the phone rather than typing them is wonderful for me since it's a bridge between the two modes there are a lot of other excellent things about this phone although i charge it at night when i go to bed i usually don't have to i only do it because i'm worried if i skip a night i'll just stop charging it altogether the problem i've had with past phones they were either off or out of charge 90 of the time because i'd forget to turn them back on or i wouldn't notice that it was out of charge usually i have at least 75 power left granted i'm not on my phone constantly doing things but i'm still very impressed with the battery life i also find that taking pictures is very easy and for the most part the pictures turn out well that said since i've never had another smartphone before i can't really compare it to other smartphone cameras although my pictures tend to come out better than my mom's iphone 4s the only issue i had was that i didn't know what the power button was not having had a smartphone before and having parents who had an ipad i thought the big button on the bottom on the phone the one you can see in the picture was the power button so one night when i had forgotten to charge my phone for several nights it simply turned off but i couldn't figure out how to turn it back on i had to watch a youtube video to see that the power button is actually on the top side of the phone i was starting to worry that the phone had actually died and i'd have to get it repaired or get a replacement or something thankfully it was just user lack of knowledge at the end of the day though it is the s pen that makes me love this phone as much as i do i just can't even imagine a phone without one,positive
484,great phone great battery life ignore 1 star review the galaxy note 3 is a great phone with great battery life and features the screen is big and beautiful the apps and features are great and the battery lasts a long time i have used the phone pretty heavily through a 12 hour shift and still had 40 left at the end of the day don't let the one star review fool you any apps you do not want can simply be disabled and the magazine app that is brought up by double tapping the home button can simply be disabled by checking a few boxes no registration necessary going into the app settings and unchecking the option for the home button leaving a one star review for something so simple to change to your liking is absurd this phone is also slim and light back cover is a nice feeling faux leather and the phone is built to last,positive
485,works great with tracfone byop i bought this phone to use with tracfone service and it works like a charm i'm very pleased that i can now use such a premium device without a contract i must be spending only 100 or less a year with tracfone to use this phone minutes data and text are tripled when purchased the phone itself is marvelous after using tracfone phones for so long i e dynamic ii ultimate 2 the note 3 is just a breath of fresh air the screen quality is super clear colors are vibrant and it runs fast and smooth the s pen is a bonus if you download the app called screen off memo from the xda forums then you can write notes on your screen while it is turned off just like the galaxy note 5 offers no complaints here this phone is a dream come true for tracfone customers note i didn't get this phone from amazon i bought it new from ebay yes it was more expensive but i didn't want to risk getting a defected device,positive
486,never thought i would switch from iphone until now even though i was heavily invested in the 'apple ecosystem' ipad imac iphone ipod all that stuff i just wanted a big screen i had the iphone 4s before and waited patiently for apple to come up with a bigger screen and the iphone 5 was a huge letdown yes longer but not wider texting on that tiny screen even in landscape was slow and i never liked the autocorrect on the iphone just mad they wouldn't listen to their customers then i was at the verizon store and saw the note 3 the display is beautiful and crisp and i love how you can customize this phone to your heart's delight first thing i did was purchase swiftkey and can almost text as fast as i type on a computer 100 wpm a lot of the same apps that i had to pay for from the itunes store are free on google play and that was nice too the note 3 blows away the iphone on processing speed so i can finally play graphic heavy games like dead trigger 2 without freezing or stuttering web pages load instantly and with a screen this large watching youtube videos no longer has me switching to my ipad my iphone 4s was only 3g and going to 4g lte was a real treat blazing fast the iphone had to be charged every day without fail i can easily get 2 full days of battery life out of the note 3 with light usage well over a day with heavy usage call quality is crisp and loud enough for me although i see others who say it isn't the stock ringtones that came with it were not loud enough but google play has lots of free ones that are pretty good the stylus is a really nice option and i can tell samsung really put time into designing it but for my purposes it's just faster to do it by keyboard artistic folks will love it another thing that's nice that apple doesn't allow is access to the battery i picked up the samsung spare battery charging system so now i never have to plug my phone in to charge just switch out batteries the only drawback is it makes using a defender case a pain so i just have a screen protector and nothing else it's also nice to have a backup in case of power outages etc holding the phone takes practice it's much thinner and lighter than the iphone 4s and a lot wider i find myself touching the screen and selecting things by accident when picking it up it looked so huge in the verizon store but after having it a few days it looks like a normal phone and everyone else's looks tiny i know a lot of my fellow tech heads bash touchwiz but i have only ever used apple so i don't know what stock android actually looks like to me it's pretty fluid i like lots of blips and beeps so it works for me not once has this phone stuttered or lagged seems like verizon is slow getting kit kat out to us but have heard others say that is pretty typical i would recommend this phone to anyone if you spend all day and night with your phone you will not be disappointed by the note 3 at all c'mon apple,positive
487,it came from outer space and changed my life it came from outer space and changed my life my old phone an original samsung note became non functional because it was a replacement phone because i'd temporarily lost the original phone apparently the replacement phones sent out by the insurance company are not always as reliable as originally purchased store items anyway the note 3 first there's the hd netflix with no buffering lag if you're caught in a dead space somewhere waiting for something this feature alone is transformative you're looking at high quality video on a miniscule screen that is as crisp as anything you'll see anywhere in your pocket in your hand anywhere you are popcorn quality that's just for starters someone leaves you a voicemail guess what you don't have to listen to it it shows up as text on the screen hi it's bob blah blah blah well you didn't need to listen to that message just erase it without having to actually listen to the blah blah blah very satisfying and time saving the camera resolution is crisp the speed is fantastic the phone feels good in your hand the faux leather backing is a winner it's light sturdy fast i use the maps function for work often the app spits out a location in five to ten seconds which is exactly how quickly i need to get it plus you get the tune in radio app which gives you the actual broadcast from any radio station around the world so you're sitting in your home town and listening to some dude in nairobi kenya talking about the latest hit single from some guy or girl you've never heard of in real time from kenya in africa or you can listen to the great courses from the teaching company their app for android is absolutely fantastic and of course it works as a phone how cool is that,positive
488,best phone i ever had this phone is amazing i previously had galaxy nexus before i had it stolen and been using the old galaxy 1 and i hated that phone because it had such a horrible battery life and weird features well this note 3 is simply amazing over 10 hours on battery with playing movies clips for good 8 hours and it still has enough juice to last another half a day great accuracies with its stylus pen and has great features like taking notes on the captured current screen with a push of a button really its a life style changer comes equipped with so many useful apps like professional version of sketchbook workout mate that can track the numbers of steps you take and monitor your heart rate although having your phone against your chest to have it measured doesn't seem like a too good of an idea and so much more it's versatility beats iphones or ipads anyday i own an ipad but this phone feels 10 times more easy to use because they offer open source for app developers you're not limited to just certain apps i'm really happy with this phone so i'd highly recommend,positive
489,great phone but has some limitations our company has used windows mobile phones in the past windows mobile is no more and the current phones they call windows phones don't even have a hint of windows in them and is a merging of a game console and a phone thus we needed to pick either ios or android we are an it company so our requirements may be different than yours what i like 1 android now has well functioning apps for rdp sftp terminals and sftp file managers to allow us to manage servers remotely 2 the large hd screen allows you to use it like a tablet or laptop 3 as with windows mobile we now have a stylus handwriting to text and voice to text 4 the battery life is not much different than our old phones and if anything better 5 it has a replaceable battery 6 it comes with a lot of internal storage and great potential for sim storage what i don't like basic missing functionality 1 there is no way to record phone calls through bluetooth it works fine from the phone itself but often people will be on the road and not be able to take notes or maybe need to forward the conversation to another employee to get them in the loop and i don't mean storing on someone else's server either which is also illegal and a violation of privacy policy 2 there is no way for someone to backup their phone to their pc and backing up on line to someone else's server is illegal in many businesses and a violation of privacy policy we are used to being able to backup to a server and restore the entire phone and settings if something bad happens from an app or other disaster 3 persistent calendar alarms like there is with texts that is crazy if you have your phone on your desk and leave the room for a second you miss it 4 fears of losing required functionality due to an ota update as has happened in the past note we are considering rooting these phones to obtain this basic functionality problems that might be specific to the phone or service 1 the conversation usually has static on my end not the customer end this is a common issue that i see mentioned in reviews while other rave about its clarity annoyances 1 it's ok to get paid for including bloatware on the phone but just don't bake it into the rom this is another reason why people want to root your phones i just pile them into a folder named zgarbage many of these programs have user agreements that are illegal and in violation of companies' privacy policies 2 my and everyone else's most hated object is my magazine flipboard it is always in the way and to get it out of the way you must agree to terms that are illegal for many businesses so the miserable thing is always popping up when people don't want it it is one great motivator for rooting and a custom rom 3 the touchwiz launcher i may be in a minority but i like as much as any of the others except a you cannot control the number of rows on screen and the default is rows spread far apart b you cannot back up your settings without rooting this you lose all of your settings if you have to do a factory reset thus you must use something like novalauncher 4 needs a gadget for wi fi to click and pick the network instead of navigating to settings because it is required so frequently another thing i miss from 2009 windows mobile 5 the default apps are scattered all over the place they need to be in one place in settings it's nice to pop up the box every time you select a default but you won't remember what it said a week later when you want to undo your default wishlist 1 lifeproof to make a case for it for people who have used lifeproof and played other cases that claim to have similar functionality it is a bigger deal than it appears to others,neutral
490,great phone but three flaws i really like this phone due to its screen size and fast processor but after using it for three weeks i noticed three problems 1 camera shutter sound no way to turn the camera shutter sound off when snapping pics quietly unless you turn off the volume of your phone if anyone has any info on how to do this without turning off the volume on the phone i'm all ears 2 air swiping and hand gestures for this phone may be ahead of the pack with current smartphones on the market but it's still buggy and unreliable by the time you swipe your hand across your phone three to four times for it to work you could have pressed the home key to turn your phone on sometimes it works most of the time it takes a few tries 3 s voice really stinks siri has it all over the galaxy on this one i asked galaxy about bowling alleys in my area five times and got a few different answers four answers unhelpful while the fifth gave me a list of local bowling alleys in my area but more so s voice is buggy as well when it fails to give me an answer to my question it offers to check the web for me but it doesn't when i click on the link to check the web the s voice program closes out otherwise this phone is truly top notch,neutral
491,charging issues with this phone this is an update to my previous at t galaxy note 3 review i have owned this phone for less than a year and there seems to be a recurring charging issue with it it has been replaced once because of that problem and i was told it wasn't due to a faulty charging cable but a systems issue with the phone now is happening again out of the clear blue it just won't charge i read in some galaxy note 3 forums that this is a common problem with this phone this is otherwise a stunning phone with an excellent battery life and tons of available useful apps at this point if this issue doesn't resolve itself soon i might have to get this one replaced as well not sure i will get a samsung phone again for further info on this issue check out this site,positive
492,love i have had this phone for about 3 months now and i love it i traded in my iphone 4s used a costco sale and various discounts and got it almost for free pros faster than the iphone much much faster more memory expandable than the iphone i have 64 gb total with a memory card large screen i can actually read my emails and kindle books on it like the pen feature although i often forget about it because i've never had one before cons my iphone had near perfect reception in my home state as well as when traveling the note 3 can be static y in the same areas lots of bloatware than drain your battery you have to stay on top of it and disable things on a regular basis not as intuitive as iphone there is a learning curve but if you are willing to learn you can customize your phone also i have mostly apple products at home including our mac which is our main computer getting the note 3 to talk to the mac took some fiddling but now it's pretty good if you are not willing to learn to use this phone to it's maximum potential get an apple product however for the money this phone is a way better device than the iphone i wish apple would catch up to android but until they do i may not go back to an iphone ever,positive
493,best phone ever not even sure where to start on this beast the 5 7 inch screen does just right by me i spend alot of time on my phone so i wanted to get the best one out there this comes with 32gb inside i added another 32gb sd card for more storage you can add up to 64 microsd card there is only room for 1 card so go with highest you think you will need tip dim down the brightness a little i took it down by about 25 to preserve battery life i threw out my old camera because it was 10 mega pixels and this phone is 13 the pictures this phone takes are second to none it runs android os which is powered by google and google play i am a google person so i am great with this feature i use the phone gps quite a bit when driving and it eats away at battery life another trick is to hold down middle button and choose close all which closes all apps running to preserve life also you can click over the task manager from same screen and do clear memory on the ram tab to flush out the memory the more apps run more often do this,positive
494,finally a beautiful samsung phone apple has always trumped samsung in one thing making beautiful sleek devices that look and feel like they warrant the price the galaxy note 3 is the first samsung device that looks like it can rival apple devices it is thin and sleek with a chrome border and straight form lines the single button is also bordered in chrome and rivals that on the new iphone 5s the rest of the features is where samsung really excels compared to apple the screen is huge but the phone fits in your pocket and hands nicely the charging is via the latest usb 3 0 which is nicely backwards compatible with your old android phone charger that used usb 2 0 none of this new proprietary lightning connector business the speaker is loud for media and speakerphone on the highways the cameras are the latest technology with 4k video recording capabilities which is the next generation of high definition tv the stylus is stored in the phone for increased capabilities there is really nothing wrong and not even anything left to be desired from this phone it is hands down the most advanced and desirable phone on the market today,positive
495,exceeding my high expectations there are so many features i love about this phone i am not sure where to start for over a year i read reviews of other phones and held off buying because i felt all phones sacrifice in some areas including key things like camera battery life removable memory processor speed quality etc when i saw the specs and read the many positive reviews i was glad to see this phone made no sacrifices however i wasn't sold until i handled it in a retail store and was amazed by the screen image quality speed and more importantly the very thin and light feel of the phone not only for a screen this size but for screen of any size some reviews complain about quality however i have to disagree i have been using this phone for 3 months without a case and it looks and feels great even after several drops i don't baby this phone and it is holding up great without a scratch the camera takes amazing photos and videos indoors many times without using flash i have received numerous complements from others especially when i project onto my 64 inch plasma tv where most phone camera flaws are exposed the video quality is so good i find myself watching sports and movies on this phone and letting family have the 64 inch plasma but i really don't feel like i'm making a sacrifice watching this beautiful screen in my hands vs the 64 inch samsung plasma on my wall its that good i am not a heavy stylus user however it comes in handy in areas i wouldn't have guessed i like using it to capture screen images and send to friends with hand scribed notes also in those moments i find myself needing pen and paper to write quick notes i prefer to use stylus over typing notes s educate is an amazing learning tool that has creative use of stylus for fun learning at all ages the speed is also amazing i rarely see the waiting spinning symbol all apps are there almost instantly the battery life typically lasts two days with about 30 60 minutes of internet music a day along with 45 minutes of navigation 30 60 minutes of videos and more each day i have never been more enthused for a product and anxious to share my experience i know of 10 15 people that tried my phone and subsequently went out to buy one a must buy definitely recommend,positive
496,swiss army knife of electronics i always thought that i was keeping my apple iphone 4s in great condition and keeping the screen unbroken iphone especially ones of an older generation are notorious for being susceptible to cracked screens so there i was sitting outside on my lunch break at work with my phone sitting on the bench playing music buzz there goes my phone vibrating off the bench i was so scared to pick up my phone but i had to see if it was broken so i finally gathered the courage to pick up my phone and as i expected it was shattered i picked up my phone and called my mother to break the news to her about my phone only to be relieved saying that she got a call from verizon wireless saying that we could get new phones so i decided to go look at new phones at verizon and i came across something extraordinary a phone a laptop or a tablet why pick one when you can have all three with the samsung galaxy note iii the note iii is a swiss army knife of all electronics the sleek not plastic back of the phone makes using the phone feel so different from other phones and tablets because it's leather and has a unique texture the unique texture has you constantly looking at your phone with all the fun and exciting design features the stunning 5 7 inch screen is very invigorating the screen is so vivid it feels like you're looking into real life rather than a virtual world being that the screen is so much larger than other newly released phones the samsung galaxy note iii is the perfect size for me being six foot four inches the larger phone fits better in my hands than the other phones that are available let's get technical the software of the note iii is an android platform with the jellybean software with the easy to navigate operating system this phone allows you to do a countless number of things although the phone is all touch screen the galaxy s pen makes navigating through the phone very easy the s pen is a very nice feature because it allows you to accurately text and type things somebody like myself with sweaty hands would be very grateful to have an s pen to keep their screen clean rather than covered in oils also the phone will not let you forget the s pen anywhere you can set it to give you a notification saying that you left your s pen somewhere it's such a great feature for forgetful people like myself for such a large phone the battery life of this phone is excellent being that i m on my phone ninety percent of the time it lasts from six in the morning until 10 30 at night without charging it anywhere in between it's very convenient for a college student especially when i m always in the library studying,positive
497,not perfect but will get most of your money's worth beware aux sound or bluetooth playback for music is poor it's a near perfect phone beautiful screen long lasting battery life and tech specs are top notch camera is good enough for my use the only thing i can say could be better is to take away the bloatware touchwiz is not the best droid shell is inefficient and clunky but runs fine with the high spec i cannot say more about the stylus i love it i actually don't mind reading or watching movies on this phone lastly a big gripe it seems like the dac sound processor on it whether if it's through aux or bluetooth needs improvement it's not the best and for my phone it's very low noise i have to turn it up maxed to hear anything i used to have an htc phone prior and had no issues the note's dac sound processor is terrible how did samsung miss such an important feature,positive
498,nice but i work for a cell provider and i've used every major phone under the sun that said i've seen the worst and t he best i chose the note 3 because of the screen size and sacrificed a few things in doing so first of all samsung's manipulation of the android os is cumbersome and a bit annoying all of the extra garbage and bloatware is a constant nuisance always asking for multiple log ins and sign ups the recently added security is a major pain and kills apps that don't need to be my biggest gripe with the galaxy line is how cheap they feel the note 3 of course being the least of the bunch but still too much plastic another issue i have with all samsung devices is the audio processor this is easily fixed by adding an eq like power amp but even with this add on fails to come close to an htc one w beats proc or an iphone samsung has accomplished a major feat going against its main rival apple but needs to keep a close eye on htc with aluminum body design and lg making major strides with devices likeke the flex and g2 i have already seen what the s5 is going to bring and i am by no means impressed so hopefully they make the 4 a much better design both internally and aestheticly but as for the note 3 i like the camera too much bloatware though the screen size and clarity the pen is useless but the software is the one thing that will keep me from buying another samsung,neutral
499,efficient and fun i originally bought the device because the stylus was just so much fun to play with the accuracy is so much greater than any bulky stylus you might experience with a standard android or ios device the phone is even capable of detecting an accurate hover and pressure sensitivity if you like to doodle or draw notes this is a must so that's all fun and good but the really impressive change from my usual experience with androids is the battery this phone just keeps kicking i am by no means a casual light phone user i surf the web with 10 tabs at a time stream music play games watch movies take pictures text and rely 100 on the built in alarm to make it to work in the morning i often let it sit out overnight without charging and not once have i had the misfortune of a dead battery,positive
500,get this phone now if you're eligible for an upgrade this phone changed the game as soon as i activated it in an authorized store it was so quick it caught the employees attention no way it activated that quickly are you sure you activated it i've never ever seen it done that fast then there's when you deal with it and see for yourself how the battery is equipped to deal with heavy usage the crisp vibrant and brilliant screen quality 5 7 inches in diameter and 1080 the 3gb of ram makes it pretty fast the usb 3 0 is awesome and an unsung praise about time this was implemented removable battery expandable memory and 32gb of onboard storage so plenty of space for apps the camera is amazing and does surround shot puts panorama to shame the phone doubles as a remote for tvs and cable boxes too what more could you want a nuclear phone people complain about touchwiz but samsungs interface is fine to me it doesn't have much bloatware i'm coming from a motorola droid 3 and that is the camera that took the pictures in this review touchwiz is fine by me and the ram pushes it fine this phone is a boss,positive
501,awesome phone so i come from a long line of iphones i never had a problem with any iphone to this day i think that they are great phones i did try several different android phones before but i always went back to the iphone because i felt that android still needed to mature into a more stable and unified platform well i think that android is definitely at that point now and it is a rock solid and great operating system for phones and tablets on the other hand i had mixed reviews about the hardware used on prior android phones the specs always seemed impressive on paper but in real life usage i was not happy with the performance of android phones when compared to my iphone experience something about them just didn't seem right that is until i got my hands on a galaxy note 3 this phone is simply amazing it has a rock solid operating system plus hardware that is blazing fast at everything plus the screen is awesome and the battery life is great the s pen has a lot of neat functionality and is not just some gimmicky gadget it is actually useful and nice to have i can finally say that i don't see anything that the iphone has that this phone does not and on the contrary i feel that i couldn't go back to an iphone because this phone offers things that the iphone cannot such as the beautiful large screen and the s pen and for those who say this phone is too big it might be for some people but i think its a great size and i have no problems carrying it around in any of my pockets,positive
502,the more i use it the more i like it this is my first smart phone i'm 67 it's taking me awhile to get used to android i still miss calls because of whatever reason but the built in gps is awesome i've been wanting to get a gps for years i was going out to breakfast and just for fun i asked it take me to mark's coney island in saline michigan and by golly it did fortunately i have a friend helping me master this thing i really am surprised i've learned it as much as i have i'm still struggling but i'll get there the battery needs charging every day but i understand there's an app that can help that,positive
503,awesome phone with great battery life i just upgraded to note 3 before a couple of days and so far i love the phone having used samsung galaxynexus phone for the past 2 years i was tired of the battery life so one of the most important criteria for choosing this phone was the good reviews about battery life the battery life is just amazing i have about 75 of battery after 12 hours of normal usage the display on the phone is pretty good and crisp the phone certainly feels big and operating in one hand seems a bit of challenge to me i think i have to get used to the fact that i have to use both the hands it is a little uncomfortable to hold the phone and talk for a long time due to its size i ordered a bluetooth headset and hopefully that should make things easier,positive
504,if you need to use it as a phone stay away i've had the note 3 for almost a year now and it was a good phone i choose this phone because i liked the large screen that allowed me to search the web and read my emails easily which worked out great for me however ever since the kit kat update i basically have a paper weight now before the update the poor call quality was tolerable for the amount of calls i make and receive but now its just useless calls aren't coming in i'm dropping calls texts are delayed or not received and basically any time i'm inside i don't even have enough signal strength to make a call now i'll have 90 of the time one signal bar and the guy next to me with an iphone will have full strength extremely frustrating i'm basically walking around with an ipod touch now this is not just me there are many threads on the net with many people having the same probably across every carrier if you are going to be on wifi majority of the time and rarely make or get calls then this a good phone but if not then stay away i hope apple comes out with a larger phone because i'm switching as soon as it comes out,positive
505,an outhouse of non removable bloatware diminishes the android experience i was so excited about this awesome phone but as the weeks turned into months the novelty has worn off and i am left with a phone full of crapware i don't want or use most annoying is this my magazine thing that pops up at random times even during emergencies updating itself with even more useless junk and slowing my smartphone experience needlessly there's a ton of bloatware embedded deep within the phone so don't think you can uninstall it and no i don't want to root the phone and possibly void my warranty and or damage the operating system i am sure many folks are rooting the phone to get rid of samsung's bloatware that's probably a major reason samsung will be foisting it's own operating system off on us in the near future so their truckload of garbage will be customer proof this is a devious business practice if they truly believed these crap apps were for the customer's benefit they would make them removable another annoying con the sound button is opposite the screen off button so get ready to turn the screen off accidentally a few thousand times when you adjust the sound also this speedy phone has slowed appreciably over the weeks things like opening the camera or especially changing from vertical to horizontal and vice versa with the screen have slowed as the creeping cancer of my magazine tasks the cpu with update after curse inducing update i mean you pull out the camera for a quick pick of your dog catching a frisbee and oh snap it's my magazine asking if you want an update or it's my magazine featuring moochelle antoinette's new 25 000 dress ugg another missed snapshot,neutral
506,ok with issues i was so excited about this device seemed like the answer for me the samsung line is a favorite of family members i went for it loved the stylus loved the capabilities of the device i liked being able to see the screen and the ability to customize certain things however with the case this becomes bulky and not at all handy for the main purpose for me i held it in my hand but not inside a case the case is really not an option you need one it's like carrying a book all the time and not a lightweight one as a phone text device ok as a camera forget it the case is in the way and the whole thing is clunky as for games my favorites did not work for me due to the bulk of the whole thing i did not like the chaotic clutter of all the preloaded stuff i'd enjoy having one of these but only as an additional item not as my 'main squeeze',positive
507,better than i even expected i have always been a samsung person but this is my first phone with them my only concern before purchasing was will it fit in my pocket and the answer is yes pros speed 3gb ram and 4 cores makes this a computer in your pocket weight screen mutliview window people always says that's large phone then i show them how i watch tv and read email at the same and they want one too google now sd card slot great camera s pen didnt think i would utilize the s pen much but after a couple weeks with the phone i find myself constantly unsheathing it i am able to swype better then ever and being able to copy a section of screen to send really impresses people cons s finder instead of google now as default that cant be changed when you purchase this phone you know you are getting a phone that is rather large so i wouldnt list that as a pro or con its a given,positive
508,even better than i expected love it even more than i thought i would i switched from galaxy s3 which i also loved to get a bigger screen longer battery life and more overall horsepower i've just been amazed and am continually stumbling on new capabilities that make this tremendously easy to use and a fantastic business and personal device,positive
509,best product forever i had an iphone 5 and it s my problem the iphone 5 s screen is small so i cannot type it right when i text to my friends because i have big hands and big fingers like all the boys are so when i use iphone i always type wrong words and my friends could not read and cannot understand what i m talking about now got a samsung galaxy note iii it s a lot better than iphone it s easy for me to type because it s big screen one more thing that when i using iphone 5 if i want to change the theme and back ground i have to go to apps store and buy it but with samsung galaxy note iii i can easy to download it and of course it s free samsung galaxy note iii is a good product with a lot of useful apps and samsung s camera is better than iphone 5 because the quality of samsung s camera is higher than iphone you can even see small details in picture while iphone 5 can t,positive
510,best available current phablet the galaxy note 3 is perfect for someone who wants a smartphone and a tablet but doesn't want to splurge on both let me start by saying the design of the note 3 is highly improved over the note 2 the screen is now 2 inches bigger and full 1080 p also the display is much brighter the new faux leather back is awesome i see some reviews knocking it but i'm not sure why it's gives it a grippy yet premium feel while still giving you access to the battery and sd card while i love all aluminum smartphones i don't like that you can't open them up to change out the battery this phone is jam packed with many features some of which don't work well and feel gimmicky such as smart stay and smart scroll it takes a while to go through the settings to configure it to your liking this phone is certainly not for everyone it's large size makes pocketability tough the stylus feature is cool for me it comes in handy when i'm out and about and suddenly need to jot something down this phone is seriously fast for web browsing and the multi window feature definitely comes in handy for instance when comparing prices on products from different websites side by side the camera is just ok with the right lighting pictures look great i'm disappointed in the lack of optical image stabilization overall there is no better phablet on the market pros 1080p stylus great battery life fast processor screen size cons camera needs some improving size not for everyone,positive
511,still one of the best phones ever made this phone is amazing from the s pen to the camera to the screen i have never been unsatisfied i purchased this phone with the intention of playing games on it and have never been disappointed the performance is excellent it has plenty of storage and expandable storage and it is durable,positive
512,the best phone ever the title is exactly how i feel the note 3 is an amazing phone tablet or phablet i purchased it a couple of days ago to replace my motorola razr maxx which i loved until it recently started to freeze and lag i had been eying the note 2 for some time and wanted to wait for the price to drop i'm glad i did not rush to buy it because now the note 3 is out and i found it half price and brand new at bb i have the original galaxy note 10 1 which i love and use consistently for work of course i would love to upgrade to the 2014 edition but first the phone and then so far i find the phone to be easy to use blazingly fast crystal clear display and the s note app is wonderful which tempts me to no end to lunge for the galaxy note 10 1 2014 lol upon purchase i transferred the sd card from the razr maxx to the note which brought up all my saved pictures that i had downloaded so no need to start over i also immediately bought the otter box defender to protect this phone as it is a worthwhile investment the phone is quite big but this is what i like and my hands are large enough to hold the phone comfortably smaller hands may find it to be a problem the phone sounds crystal clear the audio using headphones is beautiful and i will now begin to download some of my favorite apps to expand on the enjoyment of this phone system updates were available immediately upon turning the phone on and the updates downloaded with no problem at all i find the plastic screen protector with otter box to be quite smooth and does not interfere with the hand or s pen at all and i feel good knowing the screen and the whole phone is well protected i would advise a good strong case such as otter box as this phone could easily slip out of your hands mainly because of its size but also because it is a bit slippery overall i have no complaints at all but will update this review if anything else catches my attention should you decide to get this phone you will not be disappointed enjoy,positive
513,i like compare to other android phone it's been almost a month with this phone i like it i enjoy it more than i thought i would i was formerly an iphone 5 user loved apple eco system bah bah bah first impression wow it's big i wanted a big phone since i'm use to having small phone because of apple maybe sometimes too big sometimes i fell like its a perfect size so first let's start with android i had android phone in the past i keep it for a week hate it promise myself to never buy another one it was different with this phone i got to say to running android 4 3 it was a different experience android has changed a lot it's up to par with ios same issues same headaches like with any os it has it kinks you just have to figure it out android is good now there is a lot of apps out there that allows you to still share calendar with ios and vice and versa love that hardware specs are to blow you of water i love the camera amazing photo quality very much what i was use to on iphone 5 i love the display it's just amazing bottoms too me a bit to get use to them now i don't see anything wrong with them plastic is okay i wish that it was more durable i have a case since day one and i got a dent already battery i can get a whole day without charging and heavy usage two days if i use it modern and turn off all of the gps and sync battery is mainly use to power the beautiful display did i mention how beautiful it is samsung not too happy i didn't buy this phone for brand i bought it for its size and specs samsung takes a lot from android you can't use a headphones with remote without being a samsung compatible you can have certain settings without downloading apps it kinds blows it's one of the reasons for my overall rating i can't get too specific verizon great i have lots of unwanted apps to disable junkware alert no headphones included what a disappointment i can clearly say i enjoy this phone more than i though i would i really thought that i would return it but wanted to try something different i got that with this phone will i ever switch probably for now this phone is enjoyable i would recommend it,positive

515,i like it well when i wanted a bigger phone because i use it 24 7 i waited for the galaxy note 3 to arrive i must say i am pretty happy with the phone overall it's fast does more than i could ever want and i really haven't noticed the extra size in my pocket versus my droid razr xt912 it's light and compact thin anyways the s pen comes in handy and has helped me not reach for my laptop pluses thin and light speed 3g ram gorilla glass screen replaceable battery a must for me memory sd card upgradable i have a 16g will be lots of accessories s pen great usb3 0 charges fast n e g a t i v e s has a cheap feeling compared to my old kevlar and aluminum droid razr leather looking back is even cheaper feeling than the phone wifi disconnects and reconnects randomly and frequently i have had to the verizon store once with no fix i understand this is more of a wide known issue with samsung products says the forums so far it's not a deal killer because my 4g with verizon is as fast as my cable internet at home 3g ram 50 80 used up when you look at the memory manager i haven't experienced any lag issues but i worry about that as i add apps i may want super user access on this phone to prevent some services from booting and using memory usb 3 0 cable is cool and charges fast but not really economical to carry it around and the oem samsung cord sucks because it's to long and huge in a bag ok i think that sums it up if i find other flaws or gripes and i will update the review great job samsung not lets work on quality of materials and fit and finish i really think for 700 this phone should feel higher quality 06 04 13 update since i have a new internet service and router i have had zero issues with wifi connectivity,positive
516,a phablet definitely worth considering my first week of testing the samsung galaxy note 3 verizon has yielded amazing results i put on the 0 4mm tempered glass screen protector and was ready to give it a run through a myriad of tests before i decide to swap my current galaxy s4 gs4 for the galaxy note 3 gn3 size after coming from the gs4 the increased size of the gn3 is not that drastic perhaps 1mm thicker 1 2 longer 1 4 wider but somehow this yields a 5 7 screen over the gs4's 5 screen it just means you won't have to squint as hard to watch the boobies weight i am impressed by how light the gn3 is when compared to the gs4 and the gn2 there is a very slight difference of weight between the gn3 and gs4 but it's so minimal that it certainly launches the gn3 to a new level pen the pen function on the gn3 is freaking phenomenal however i believe this is solely an os issue and not related to hardware i found that the papyrus app to be more to my liking than the included apps speed oh my freaking chupacabra this sucker is fast noticeably so over the gs4 snapdragon 800 quad core processor clocked at 2 27 ghz holy moly this puts the gs4's specs quad core processor clocked at 1 9 ghz to shame memory 3 gb of memory vs the 2 gb in the gs4 storage glad to see samsung boosted the stock storage from 16 gb as found in the gn2 and gs4 to a whopping 32 gb i won't actually need an extra sd card now battery 25 hours of talk time unmodded unrooted are you serious wowzers this 3200 mah battery is the bomb boasting a 22 day standby time gs4 has a 2600 mah battery and gets around 20 40 less talk standby time 84 hours of music playback anyone yes please after 4 days and 2 hours my battery is finally at 49 with wifi on camera same as what's on the gs4 which is awesome video 4k video wait what are you kidding me and up to 120 fps slow motion capture oh this is going to be fun 3840x2160 4k 30 fps 1920x1080 1080p hd 60 fps 1280x720 720p hd 120 fps for reference the gs4 only does 1080p hd at 30 fps no wonder it took the 2 spot for top camera function on a phone the only reason it didn't is somehow that s ty windows nokia phone scored half a point higher in camera function in addition to the image stabilizer featured in the gs4 the gn3 also includes continuous auto focus this is a huge improvement over the gs4's video capabilities i took several videos with the gs4 and it was constantly loosing focus not anymore with the gn3 google wallet it's back i think it's great that google wallet once again works on the gn3 i used to use it all the time on my developer version of the galaxy nexus google discontinued official support for this app on the gs4 for whatever reason though a modded version could be applied knox an efuse that defaults to 0x0 any attempts currently to modify the bootloader results in tripping knox or setting the efuse to 0x1 does this have any effect on the phone itself no it only means that once tripped your warranty is void as with rooting or adding a custom bootloader as it always has been only now samsung has a way to track this rooting full root and 0x0 knox bypass has been established for the gn3 i believe the xda community is currently working on a way to add a custom bootloader without tripping knox this is definitely a great device to consider if you are looking to go with a phablet,positive
517,we got one of these at best buy for verizon and it keeps rebooting every 10 we got one of these at best buy for verizon and it keeps rebooting every 10 or 15 minutes making it worthless best buy adamantly refuses to do anything about it saying we must go through samsung we've also tried verizon and get the same run around saying that we must go through samsung we've sent it to samsung repair twice they send it back and it still has exactly the same problem just today we called samsung again and got another rma and are sending it back again samsung says that they have no way of replacing the phone and that they can only repair it i was getting to where i liked samsung but this is absolutely the worst situation i've been in in a long time i feel completely abused and discarded by samsung's verizon's and best buy's word to sell me a usable product sorry for posting this on amazon but i'm now trashing this samsung phone everywhere i can,positive
518,this is the real deal i usually have a love hate relationship with my phone after a period of 6 months i am done with it and ready for a change i have only had this one a few weeks but it really does tick all of the boxes it has great pic quality amazing battery life 32gb of storage super fast data retrieval all you need i don't think that in 6 mo i will be looking for a new phone,positive
519,wow the best ever i was worried about the size but it is the best phone i have ever owned i have an ipad and a kindle fire but to be honest i don't need them anymore i can not imagine a better phone than this fast amazing camera big screen for reading e books surfing replaceable battery an extended memory option huge application choices the only thing i didn't like about this phone that my daughter wants to play games using it instead of her ipad sorry apple you are a little bit behind,positive
520,no reception i really loved this phone until the update over the past 2 months since the update the reception has been terrible and suddenly i can barely send a text without it failing i have pretty much surmised that this has only been since the update a couple of months ago in the two months prior the phone was great i have contacted everyone numerous times over this and they pretty much confirmed my suspicions it is quite disappointing to spend so much on this phone just to have it all die out with no fix available if you do get this phone i suggest you do not update it or any of the other new samsung phones while it may be great in city areas it has certainly declined here to an almost unusable level,positive
521,like the size love the size of the screen doesn't feel silly big the camera is awesome and love some of the s pen features the four stars is for some dropped calls and it seems to change ring volume not sure if this is the phone or some app this is not a deal breaker because i really like some of the other options,positive

525,not good enough there's a lot of annoying issues with this phone 1 50 apps will probably crash the phone i cannot turn off the headphone and airplane mode warning is it really necessary to warn me all the time when i write horizontally my palm would always either block the light sensor or hit the home button it pretty annoying the ui is slow takes almost 2 seconds to load up s note or a quick note evernote syncs takes forever for the site to update my snotes snote takes almost 2 seconds just to turn a page the 4k camera is really shaky and cannot record more than 5 minutes even though i have space for it the home screen does not rotate with the default launcher this phone is no where close to the smoothness of my old iphone 5 i would not recommend this phone,neutral

529,wow lazy review but i had to get my score in i've been a galaxy 1 anf galaxy 3 owner for years loved them both but the note 3 is pro league in comparison not as big as you think within minutes you'll expect its size and your old phone will look so small think of your 55 plasma to your old 32 you used to love pen is for me too super fast screen is so good it looks like one of those ad stickers to me if you get me more later,positive
530,i want my iphone back i read all the reviews on this phone they all seemed good i was attracted to the screen i really liked the large size of it and the pictures seemed pretty good too so i went from my iphone to the galaxy note,positive
531,caution use of s pen on screen protectors the phone is awesome and i'm leaving a review to warn others of the only issue i've run into it's not even with the phone it's with the pen and screen protector just be really gentle when you use it because depending on the screen protector you have it'll leave pen marks that you can see when the screen is off and the sunlight is shining on it just a fair warning the s pen is pretty sharp,positive
532,burn baby burn dont buy this phone there are a lot of 5 star reviews but i will say this my phone after having it for 4 months caught on fire samsung after reporting it to them did nothing to rectify the situation horrible customer service got a used refurbished phone with no back no new battery no new stylus pen had to use the ones from my old burnt phone,negative

540,it's a great phone but note 3 has poor services in many locations i bought my note 3 last fall it works fine at the location i usually live i have a summer place which is 20 minutes away my note 3 has very bad signals i could not even place a call out the battery goes dead very quick i had iphone before which i had no trouble at both locations the rest of my families all have iphones nobody has troubles at the summer house when i spent almost all week to google note 3 problems i was shocked to see how many people had reported and discussed the similar problems switching to a new sim didn't help in my case which many other had already done i highly doubt verizon could fix it at all when my contract is over i'm definitely switching back to iphone,neutral

545,camera not good i've had this phone for about 6 months and already want to trade it for an iphone 6 plus i hate the camera my daughter is in gymnastics and when i take her pictures from my seat they all and always come out with blurry face i tried all the modes and everything and nothing works i have never gotten a clear picture and she's not too far from where i'm sitting hate it i've had i phones before and i definitely like their camera better,negative
546,one star it says a verizon phone but doesn't work with verizon don't buy it basically rip off,neutral
547,nice toy but has issues i've had the note 3 and previously the 2 and with both i had bad signal and it would constantly overheat sometimes the phone would be idle and still overheat i replaced it twice and same issue this phone has a lot of bells and whistles but lacks reliability,neutral
548,love the phone hate the policy i have the original unlocked international version of the galaxy note n7000 and i absolutely love it and i was about to purchase a note 3 until i read the reviews when i pay 500 800 dollars for an unlocked phone i should be able to add or remove apps and activate it anywhere even my current phone has apps that i can't remove unless i root the phone i'm certain that the galaxy note 3 is a phenomenal phone it's samsung's policy akin to retaining partial ownership that i find offensive until that changes i won't buy a samsung product samsung's motive is erecting an obstacle to the gray market as far as i'm concerned the gray market is also the free market governments and companies love to tout the free market but won't hesitate to manipulate interfere with it don't expect me to be complicit i'm not sure what the gray market direction is but if it's from the us to other countries i suggest sellers look into purchasing cheap sim cards from straight talk for the initial activation i'm not sure if it will work but anything to contribute to the failure of samsung's idiotic business decision,neutral
549,beware zonelocked i bought the galaxy note 3 out of contract because i travel a lot between europe and the usa and i need to switch between sim cards often however the so called unlocked version of the note 3 is actually region locked so that if you buy it in europe it will not accept any sim from the usa and vice versa and of course i had no idea of that limitation nor did my seller afterwards i found on the internet people saying that samsung could unlock my device if i complained hard enough that i did but they did not i am now stuck with a half useless phone thanks but no thanks samsung too bad the note 3 when in its locked region is actually a great phone,negative
550,samsung's noise problem when i start my car with the note 3 bluetooth on samsung feels compelled via the smartphone to say something like good morning i hope you have a nice day actually i'm not interested in samsung being part of the family like that i just want a smart phone ironically their message degrades what was starting as a nice day maybe i've turned the radio on suddenly there are two sound sources it's distracting and while driving maybe this can be turned off i think i found a way once but then it reverted i don't want to spend a lot of time learning how to deal with this samsung does the same with their washers and dryers basically good machines they will wait until you're unloading clothes with ear next to the machine then hit you with a jingle why it's too bad because the note 3 is generally a great smart phone but with the samsung's fixation on popping people with the sound intrusion i can't rate it better than 1 star,positive
551,samsung good amazon verizon bad phone is great love it when my company cancelled my work phone i was happy to pick this up but trying to transfer my number was a disaster verizon figured out how to do it and credit things correctly but amazon is lost wants to charge me the full cost of the phone even though verizon said everything was ok just want to keep my same number if i have to i will be sending the phone back and never trying to do this type of thing with amazon ever sometimes you just need a human,positive
552,oversized garbage i made the move from an iphone to the samsung galaxy note 3 about 4 months ago since then it's brought me nothing but trouble i have to restart the phone on a daily basis just to make calls the phone constantly overheats and doesn't hold a charge for longer than 6hrs on standby i've never downloaded games or any other questionable apps the phone is just crap compared to the iphone,negative
553,can't get past the eligibility for upgrade form ive used three different computers three different browsers on recommendation from amazon support and can't get past the screen that checks your eligibility for upgrade to a new device i have had my current contract with verizon for two and a half years i was eligible for upgrade in august sucks that i now have to pay 299 99 to verizon for the samsung galaxy note 3 which is offered here for a 179 99 upgrade major fail amazon and i was thinking about coming to work for you in dupont fat chance with this debacle and your questionable corporate policies not liking the tease,negative
554,my magazine is baked in the home key you cannot remove it really samsung you integrate the most used key center home button on your phone and add my magazine function to it if you press the home key twice you are automatically greeted to the my magazine feature and then you must register and agree to the terms before you can disable it i bought your phone for the excellent hardware not your half baked software by forcing me to agree the terms in order to disable it you've achieved the exactly opposite this is extremely infuriating and off putting virtually 90 of review sites mock your bloatware and you insist that the consumers will like it you're not google and never will be stick with the hardware something you're superb at it and leave the bloatware for your employees this one is going to be returned immediately due to your inability to learn from your mistake those who failed to learn from history are doomed to fail so they say stop forcing people using your crapware seriously i was really looking forward to using my note 3 but this garbage my magazine singlehandedly turned me off to the point of switching to another device good job samsung,neutral

556,fantastic phone for those who want to be productive i bought the first couple of iphones when they first came out and use my wife's every now and then and i've also owned 4 or 5 different android devices and the note series is by far my favorite i purchased a note 2 when it first came out and loved it so i decided to go with the note 3 and it is an even better version of an already great phone i was debating between this the s5 and the htc one m8 but i went with the note and took the hit in processing power for and extra gb of ram which is amazing i've already rooted and installed the hyper drive rom but even without the extras of a custom rom this phone has so many features that make it a fantastic productivity tool the s pen alone is something that i use literally every day at work to take meeting notes i work with meeting software that allows you to share your screen so i can do that while also taking nones on my note 3 without showing everyone what i'm writing down then i sync with evernote and have all of my notes in the cloud it's perfect fantastic phone with a great price here on amazon couldn't be happier,positive
557,new fan of samsung because of the note 3 this review is for the note 3 in general but also as a recommendation for laptopangels if that happens to be the seller somebody might be looking at i gave laptopangels a 5 star review for sales and shipping as well as for handling a return with courteous professionalism the phone the phone the phone the phone i take back every bad thing i've ever said about samsung the 2 year old note 3 stacks right up there with every 2015 phone i've had my hands on my daily driver is a droid turbo and this note 3 is every bit as much fun to drive as my turbo is i should qualify by saying that the note 3 we eventually bought is still running kitkat 4 4 2 so i can't speak for this phone with lollipop 5 x installed and we plan to keep it on kitkat one big reason we were in the market for an older phone was an increasingly severe dislike for lollipop basically this phone replaces a new lg g4 with 5 1 which replaced a g3 with 5 0 and the new owner could not be any happier she had a galaxy note ii before and it croaked which was the only reason she needed another phone it was my mistake to steer her toward lg should've considered the note 3 in the first place samsung definitely got it right with this one,positive
558,awesome phone best on market best phone things you should know 1 best battery life than any other android phone i have had 2 most features that are exclusive for this phone i thought i would use i do not for example i do not use the stylus as much as i did the recent update killed the ease of use and coverting text from handwriting to text so i do not use it anymore 3 fast response have had this phone for about 9 months still just as fast responding to touch and opening apps as day one 4 can only be used with a max mini sd card of 64gb this is a minor complaint only 5 does not get hot unless you are doing a lot of stuff while charging this device does not get hot to the touch the normal running temp is about 100 degrees fahrenheit but you can not feel it 6 charges fast from dead to full charge this is based on stock charger that comes with phone which pushes 2 1 amps i also use a 3 5 amp car charger which it charges faster with 7 the ir ability i use a lot for controlling my tv and dvr the app the phone comes with is the best app but the app does need improvement though this is not the phones fault 8 wifi is fast my internet speed tops at 40mb s and the phone wifi can do it unlike most phones wifi usually cap at 20mb s no matter what 9 i have the verizon 4g lte and the lte i have seen push 60mb s for speeds so again the phone ability for strong and fast signal is impressive a bunch of other things positive and negative i am disappointed in samsung and their lack more rather restrictions of app abilities but this is not the phone fault great phone and best i have had,positive
559,horrible customer service when i receive this device i have many options this was the more expensive for replacing my device only reason why i was getting the new samsung phone was because my device has stopped charging so i purchased a charger so that i can charge the battery as well as the phone app on received device i noticed that the screen did not display the actual time as well as it did not charge the phone the original charger for the samsung note was not in the box i received the secondary charger that does not work to charge the phone advised that the merchant please send a new phone and i would send the other back because i didn't want to be without a cell phone i never received any other information regarding my request since then i have purchased batteries so that i can swap the batteries out and charge them through the charger that i purchase that will allow me to charge the battery it's real inconvenient because now i have to spend more money and my phone is not under warranty and i don't want to be without a phone i think that the merchant could have sent out another phone or a new charger to accommodate my situation never again will i purchase devices from this month,neutral
560,used note 3 to replace broken droid bionic wow what a phone i had long ago decided to replace my aging droid bionic with a samsung galaxy s4 but a phone guru friend recommended that i consider the note 3 instead of a galaxy s4 as a replacement for my old tired and broken droid bionic after reading several reviews comparing the note 3 with the galaxy s4 and speaking with a local cell phone expert i decided to spend 385 on a note 3 instead of 250 for a galaxy s4 when i placed the amazon order for the note 3 i wondered if 385 versus 250 for a galaxy s4 was well spent well after spending several hours learning how to use my loaded with features note 3 i am happy that i spent the additional 135 compared to my bionic not a fair comparison i know the note 3 is screaming fast and has lots of features that i hope to master in a month or two if a potential user checks out any of the dozen or so youtube videos re the outstanding features of the note 3 snapdragon quad 800 great gpu 3mb ram stylus and on and on and you might consider the note 3 or note 4 if price is no consequence as your next smart phone i found several reviews comparing the note 3 to the note 4 that recommend the user stay with their note 3 unless upgrading to a note 4 is virtually free one reviewer indicated that by late 2015 a successor to the note 4 will be available with many improvements though i can't imagine what can be done to improve the note platform my note 3 is another samsung gem,neutral
561,great for busy man we had a verizon upgrade coming to us so i was looking for a all in one device for my husband he just wanted a phone and tablet i saw a friend with this note 3 and knew he would love it he checked it out in the store and excited about everything but the price just as we got our upgrade the note 3 went to 1 i grabbed it he loves it the screen is big enough for reading the phablet is small enough to palm he only has 1 device to keep track of he doesn't want a tablet at all now the note 3 runs on the same android 4 4 as note 4 and if you sign in with samsung they upgrade you to 5 0 between the note 3 and 4 there really isn't a lot of difference so we went for price i was going to get one too but the price went back to 100 i was concerned about the size note has a 5 7 screen for me to hold on to with the kids in my arms i got the galaxy s5 with a 5 1 screen it's only a little smaller and fits my life better samsung also upgraded s5 to 5 0 the pro and con on note 3 is the size 5 7 ins it's prefect for some and to big for others if you want a all in one go with the note if you want screen size but smaller phone go with s5 i highly recommend both,positive
562,love this phone how many ways can i say i love this phone i needed a new phone because my other verizon phone was on its way out i did not want to sign up for another two year contract nor did i want to rent a phone for the next two years so while doing my research and asking around i came to discover that this phone is capable of having the battery changed well that was a great selling point since my previous phone was only lasting half a day without needing to be recharged unfortunately many phones today cannot have their batteries replaced when they are getting older that is why the samsung galaxy note 3 was so appealing to me in addition i am no youngster and need a big screen to see and this phone is perfect for that it feels great in my hands and so far i am really enjoying using it it was a great choice,positive
563,so far so good so far i love it just got it a few days ago but already easily adjusted to the screen size which was my biggest concern it's really only a little bigger than my old phone droid razr they have a function that makes it easier to use with one hand if you like but i find i can still reach around and do most things with a little stretch i have small average hands the stylus is really awesome especially that i can take notes in lecture and not have to worry about my hand making marks on the screen when i rest it which was a huge problem with my ipad with the stylus and the s note app comes pre installed i can write in it as clear and naturally as in a paper notebook huge bonus when it comes to storing notes and wishing i had them to refer back to years later but didn't want to store those notebooks forever no gripes yet but i'm pretty vocal if i come up with one i'll post it oh and huge tip from the verizon lady the old chargers work the plug is totally different and supposedly the included charger will charge it faster but the older plugs actually fit and charge the phone so happy i don't have to get all new accessories car charger and more wall chargers for work and home recommend this one over the s4 does the same stuff but bigger with a little more functionality supposedly the processor is faster too,positive
564,love it but apps i switched from iphone to this android phone and love the bigger screen the hd video display the camera is decent though not as good as i expected pixelation and spotty but does excellent video even in dark locations such as a night club the dual video capture is fun to play with 2 screens in one video showing the person in the scene being recorded for example it comes loaded with general apps no games however i've had problems with it on many google services such as hangouts and youtube sharing many games and apps aren't supported on android the battery is quickly used up and it takes a couple hours to charge from zero to 100 i've hardly used the pen but i love the design for holding the pen inside the phone body it is secure and never loosens so far i don't like the design of having the off button opposite the volume button as it took forever to learn how to push one without pushing them both holding the phone on the bottom is awkward because of the menu buttons so it took some time to find a way to hold it all in all i'd recommend it even to 1st time users of smart phones it's very easy to set up and use and for experienced users to customize,positive
565,great buy first off i bought this phone used from cellular trendz there was an issue with the camera but they were great and worked with me to get the part to fix the issue before a big event came up i was replacing an lg g2 that i had after many drops finally killed and had no insurance on i liked the g2 but i have to say i love the note 3 if i could have afforded the note 4 i would have gone with that but for my needs and budget you really can't beat the note 3 i love the size which is so much easier on my eyes i draw so i do find the s pen really useful for doodling on the phone i don't do any heavy gaming so i've had no issues with lagging or memory it does have bloatware that samsung should really let you delete but other than that this phone knocks it out of the park especially for a phone that isn't on the bleeding edge any more looking back i really wish i'd originally gone with this phone instead of the g2,positive
566,top phone on the market as of this review i would have to say that 90 of my computer usage is via my mobile phone now a days and i constantly read tech news and keep up to speed on advancements in mobile computing only having my note 2 for a year i was in the market for a new phone because i decided to switch to verizon i was torn between the note 3 and the htc one max most would say these are not fair comparisons because they are not in the same tier but for me the one max was very enticing i loved the idea of the front facing speakers slightly larger screen and better build but what sold me was replaceable battery better gpu in the snapdragon 800 and amazing amoled screen i'm partial to the screen due to the deep blacks and infinite contrast what has surprised me about the phone is the new quick charge 2 0 feature in the sd800 it charges extremely fast,positive
567,too fragile for me i was really excited to get this phone my old one was really doggin it my husband had gotten one earlier and really likes his after having it for about a month one day red started showing on the screen and then got really bad verizon said that it was cracked it was never dropped or mistreated he replaced it and we thought it was just an unusual occurrance well the second day after i bought mine i was squeezing the sides as i pushed the buttons to raise the volume and suddenly noticed that it had cracks across the screen then the screen went black i hadn't even had the thing three whole days i started reading of other people having problems with the screen cracking and having to replace this screen multiple times so i immediately returned this and will not be getting this model,neutral
568,battery charging problems after a few months i decided to wait utnil i reviewed this phone we ordered four of these for our family and we have had them for five months now one of the phone had to be replaced after we got it because it would not hold a charge so we got a replacement for that one now after five months all four phones are having charging problems my wife's phone will not charge anymore no matter what cord we use all other phones you have to jiggle the cord and have it placed in certain way to charge and then it takes way too long to charge this is an obvious manufacture defect one phone i can understand but four phones or actually five if you count the one that was replaced that is unnaceptable and poor quality control and design on samsung's part this will be the last samsung phone we buy it's unfortunate as the phone has great features but it does no good if you can't charge the phones properly so beware you could have battery charging problems after a few months,neutral
569,i really was reluctant to purchase a samsung device but then all that changed all right here is an honest review about the note 3 it's something that i will approach from the perspective of someone in the medical field who needs to get things done quickly and efficiently first of all i received my phone on october 10th and i had pre ordered it but did not pay 299 well initially i did but there is a promo code of verizon30 that drops the note 3 down to 209 99 i bought the note 3 for myself and the lg g2 for my wife needless to say at the price of 139 99 for the g2 and 209 99 for the note 3 we returned the g2 for the note 3 despite the g2's incredible low light camera performance here is why backstory prior to buying the note 3 i have had the droid razr maxx which for its time was a great device now that apps are becoming more memory intensive something needed to change i needed a phone that wouldn't lag on me and i really don't care about gimmicks such as scrolling while looking up or down or pausing a video if i look away who really cares about that stuff if i want to pause i tap on the screen which is less time consuming that looking away and ensuring my phone has paused playing a video in addition i really don't want that front facing camera on unless i am using it also i was always reluctant to buy a samsung phone because of the plastic build but you know i always keep my phone in a safe case i will talk about this a little later now right before i let go of my razr maxx i briefly upgraded to the note 2 for 2 days i chose the note 2 because i was in best buy and was comparing the htc one which best buy had on sale for 50 and all of a sudden i decided to listen to the note 2's speaker i was blown away in comparison to the razr maxx but blown away which how much more i got in comparison to the htc one we are all going to large screens now and frankly who the heck wants to hold the phone closer to their face i certainly don't so i upgraded to the note 2 i really did not fall in love with it until the day i was sitting in my senior human cadaver anatomy course and realized i had forgotten my anatomy atlas and my notebook i frantically searched the note 2 and found an app called s note i opened s note and began using it i was blow away there are blood vessels that are large and really thing and i used to be able to only differentiate that on paper not this time with the note 2 i was able to use the thin and thick lines as differentiators thanks to the s pen i then made my decision that i would return the note 2 and wait for the note 3 because of the larger screen and faster processor in addition i had a memory intensive anatomy app running on the note 2 that smoothly ran it when my hp touchpad running android decided to begin hiccupping now with all that said this is why i feel the note 3 is the best choice on the market first of all if your going to purchase a phone that you are spending your hard earned money on it it should be in the most secure and safest cases it's an investment that when 2 years later you sell back you can almost pay for your new device second of all we will all drop our phones at some point and its important to protect them i purchased the spigen bounce case despite it being slightly ugly i got the gray one because incipio ngp tpu cases are not yet available for this phone that case kept my razr maxx in like new condition now i really protect my phone because i have my entire life on it my class schedule my hospital schedule my family schedule my kids doctors appointments my appointments my tests etc everything so i needed a phone that was behind me 100 and never let me down it has been the case with the note 3 i have customized it and it still hasn't hiccupped yet now the actual review screen productivity the large display is fantastic it is large enough to hold a full month calendar on one home screen and 3 days on another i absolutely love the vivid screen because my anatomy apps as well as using it to take notes is an absolute breeze my only recommendation is to add many pages before you begin in lecture or whatever you want to take notes in there are many times where i find inspirational quotes on facebook fb and wish i could save them and tag them to share not via fb but text messages etc scrap book has allowed me to do just that i can share inspirational quotes and pictures with anyone and it's a breeze to look them up by placing my own personal tags for each photo i hold the menu button type inspiration and bam i have all my things that are tagged inspirational sometimes i also need a list of diagnostic medical conditions and it's easy to quickly create a scrapbook memo or create a flow chart in s note etc in fact the other day i was talking to verizon and needed to write down the conformational code etc for my second note 3 and you know what i did i was on the dialer page pulled out the s pen and circled the page then i notated it with all the information it contains the date the time and all the information i need to have in case something went awry i absolutely love this feature and it is very important another feature i love is that when i am on youtube i can load hd very quickly the lg g2 did a good job in this too but the razr maxx despite being an lte phone did not handle this very well another thing i really love on this phone straight out of the gate is that it tells me how many text messages i have like an unread count its something i like it also has many accounts built right in such as amazon facebook etc i was able to disable most of the bloat ware by going to manage applications and clicking disable in some of the pre loaded verizon apps the ir blaster is great i've already started using it on all my tv's however it wont turn the volume up on my lg tv but do every else in addition i am able to have in memory which room has which tv and so when i switch rooms i also switch rooms on my phone which allows me to use it as a remote great when you have to hide the remote from your little ones battery life used it for an entire day hardcore and its still at 31 at the end of the day after about 6 am to 1 am usage update 10 23 13 see the attached screen shot of battery usage i was pretty impressed i do know for a fact though that s health eats battery life like crazy also i love the speaker placement on the bottom of the phone because it's just smart when i hold my phone it cups around the speaker channeling the sound directly to me and not the entire audience behind my phone smart people have complained about the flip board app but keep in mind this is android and not ios we have choices here download an app called home 2 shortcut and it allowed me to configure double tapping the home button to start google now rather than anything else its fantastic and a great use of android capabilities i will update more here the s pen i received was faulty with my phone and so verizon sent me a brand new one for free not taking off stars for that during the pre order stage stuff like that happens every once in a while the spen was completely usable i just had to add a little extra pressure but no worries it's taken care of and all is well the power button has a slight lag when you just tap it to turn on the screen if you give it a robust tap it comes on quicker it is quickest to turn on the screen using the home button when it's sleeping it kind of irritates me that it is that way note 10 23 13 it maybe quicker to use the home button to do the same thing i wish samsung allowed customization of the led colors for the types of notifications note 10 23 13 re reception issues i know people have complained about reception issues but truly i haven't had many just a couple here and there i think the reality is that the note 3 is slow at switching networks etc so rather than wait i have just downloaded a refresh network app which does what i need in less than 15 seconds and gives me a fresh connection i don't see it as much of an inconvenience especially because the many positives of this device outweigh this one negative i haven't had no reception anywhere tethering by the has been pretty amazingly fast with this phone and it does not get hot i love that my razr maxx used to be a meteorite when it was tethering more to come update 12 13 13 i apologize it has been a while to update i absolutely still love this phone and i wouldnt change much about my review i will say that i have experience reception issues but they are sooo seldom i believe ive refreshed the network about 4 5 times since i have wrote the initial review and now ive been informed that there is an app that allows you to customize the colors of the led to what you want excellent so thats definitely a negative taken away i had been using my phone with a spigen screen protector and initially i liked it but now with using the s pen and it aging i really am beginning to dislike that screen protector i have just ordered a tempered glass screen protector and will update later about that one thing i have learned is to save everything from action memo to scrapbook or s note if you want to hold onto it in case your phone needs to be reset i had to reset my phone once but it was due to the foxfi app and it causing certificate issues once i reset it it fixed it another note the spigen case protector i was talking about it is great however i have found that the squared edges make it uncomfortable for my hand to hold when i remove the case i can handle the phone pretty easily with one hand even though i have hands on the smaller side so i have ordered a case that has rounded edges rather than squared edges whatever you do do not get a metal case for your phone because it will reduce your signal quality other than that the phone has been running great and i will update it again soon,positive
570,fantastic phone i loved all the specs on this phone when i was doing my research for the most part it seemed that the phone was pretty solid for performance based on everything i was reading my primary concern going in was the issue that i kept seeing appear regarding the call quality i finally pulled the trigger when i saw that there was a fix for that issue i have had the phone for over a month now and i can report that i have had no issues with any aspect of the phone call quality has been great i have had no problems with running any apps and even multiple apps at a time it does not lag the battery life is the best of any phone i have ever owned even better than the extended battery i had for my previous phone i can typically go at least 2 days on a charge i consider myself to be an average user of the phone on a typical day i will run several apps send and receive multiple texts do some surfing and make several phone calls the size of the phone may be the sticking point for some people i was a little hesitant in this respect also at first but i can say that i got used to the size in a very short time and now can't imagine myself with a smaller phone i love it i think this phone was a great purchase and am not disappointed in it at all,positive
571,great phone have had it over a month now great phone have had it over a month now and am extremely pleased with the note 3 i had the samsung galaxy s iii and was 2 yrs old was time to upgrade the samsung galaxy note 3 has a solid reputation and rather than wait for the note 4 with no track record i opted for the note 3 glad i did only one caveat i have found is do not buy a protective case that has a magnetic closure tab because that can interfere with the note hand writing function have had no issues getting used to thise phablet sized phone in fact i find i'm preferring it because the screen is larger makes texting much easier camera is surprisingly good for indoor photos but finding it's not as great for brightly lit scenes such as taking shots of landscapes using auto better off using the manual settings for that,positive
572,a great phablet that's much better than its os the note 3 is a great rendition of the android operating system it's only shortcomings are really from the os not the hardware physically it doesn't feel as big as its size compared to other phones on the market and samsung has added some of their own tweaks to make the size even less of an issue my biggest complaint is that too many of the apps and the interface itself simply make everything bigger on the big screen rather than taking advantage of the size to include more usable content there's no reason why a screen this size still only has 4 columns of app icons but there are other front ends available that remedy that situation making the note 3 an even better tool the phone works well but its interface is just about the worst i've seen again it's an os issue and android needs to 'borrow' some ideas from hp's excellent but defunct webos connectivity has been excellent both 4g and wi fi the 13mp camera is outstanding the s pen makes editing sketching and note taking a breeze,positive
573,fast with features love love love so you would have to want a big phone i carry a purse so it doesn't bother me at all i love the huge screen i actually watch shows on it's comfortable it doesn't really feel like it's a phone i mainly upgraded from the noteii for the camera which i use everyday to capture kids moments for that alone it is a big improvement 8mb to 13mb a bunch more modes controls there are voice commands new s pen capabilities so it is worth it for me because i use all of them a lot if you are torn between the note 2 or note 3 i would go with the 3 you will have for 2 years the technology is worth it oh internal memory is 32 gb too nice for all the photos videos you will capture it is a really fast overall great phone i can't imagine anyone not liking all the great features,positive
574,a lot of cool features like other good quality smart phones this phone is well made and has great performance there for it is better to write about features this p hone has and others don't the size of the screen and quality or clarity it has kept me away from my computer i basically do almost everything with this phone what separates it from other phones is the ability to take notes using the included s pen with ease you can actually write down something on the notepad and let you link it to something else for example you can write down someone's phone and click on it to initiate the dial keypad or write a website or physical address and click on that to bring up a browser or a google map to navigate basically there is no other phone that competes with galaxy note 3 in this regard with the auto correction feature when typing something it is difficult to have typos in what you are writing the thing that follows your eye when reading to help you scroll works but not sure how to make it do that on purpose it just does it every now and then when reading small prints you can hover over the content with a finger and it magnifies the content a lot of cool features i have yet to figure out the battery life is great it has a good size battery that lasts more than a day with normal use youtube and use of pandora may require you to charge or plug it for a few minutes,positive
575,after several months of using the phone i've decided after several months of using the phone i've decided to make my review first off i noticed the orientation sensor was not working correctly the camera is stuck in landscape so i have to manually rotate pics on edit before sharing them i recently had to do a factory reset because i woke up one day and the time on the phone was off by 1 hour and 8 minutes it was very strange i tried everything i could think of before deciding a reset was necessary in the process now of getting everything back to way i had it before eliminating some apps that might have caused the problem also after a reset at time i received phone and this recent one the orientation is still not working i have checked numerous sites looking for answers to this issue with no workable solutions any help in this area would be appreciated outside of these issues the phone is exactly what i wanted when i ordered it,neutral
576,great screen and battery life that's it purchased this for my mom since she loves the giant screen and has a hard time reading small font however imo between the screen and battery life that's all i like about this phone i hate samsung's bloatware joke of a ui and their build construction coming from several years of using apple products and now the new htc one m8 the samsung phones feel like children toys to be fair there are some intuitive features about the note 3 use of stylus but i just can't stand how much bloatware is on this thing if it were my phone i would have returned it already but since i've had to help teach my mom how to use this thing well maybe the ui is better off for someone like her the smartphone is fully functional in it's condition but if you are like me and want a pure android feel stay clear from this phone,positive
577,don t buy this is a horrible phone it was really slow and the battery wouldn t keep charge they sent me the wrong charger so i had to buy one separately it would be 100 charged and within an hour it would be on 15 and light up and tell me to connect my charger i have kids and a job i need a phone that actually works i am returning this today i regret buying it,negative
578,hight functional and old version is a fraction of the latest models replaces my old one which died way cheaper than the new samsung s7 edge which i also purchased and just as functional i will use it as backup if the s7 breaks the devices are so sophisticated that i can easily get by with a device a couple of years out of date now i really don't need much higher than full hd resolution and the micro sd slot takes just as much memory 128 gb as the s7 plus i already had extra batteries and charger from the old one i have to be really careful not to damage the s7 battery by over discharging the note 3 i just get a new 20 or less battery,positive
579,wife loves it i bought as a gift for my wife who absolutely loves this phone given that her eyesight is poor she really appreciated the large screen i was surprised but she actually uses the stylus quite a bit i find that ever since she got the phone she is much more responsive to emails as well this was also surprising because she has been against transitioning to a touch screen keypad in many ways this phone really bridges the gap for her between a phone and a tablet whereas she would use her nook for internet browsing gaming and other activities she now does all of that on the note and really only uses her nook for reading for years she's been telling me she had the lesser phone i have the iphone i haven't heard that ever since she started using this phone,positive
580,one of the best android phones out there one of the best android phones out there it only takes about a half hour to charge and takes almost two days to be completely dead atleast that is how it is for me i have had this phone for about four years jumping from phone service carrier to other phone service carriers and i still enjoy it even though i had repurchased it again when switching to a different phone service provider because i loved it so much if your looking for an electronic easy access hand notebook with a efficient camera and a strong battery this is a great phone choice for you,positive
581,terrific phone everyone at work laughs at me when i answer my laptop i don't care this phone is terrific and i'm looking forward to implementing this tool into my daily routines at home and work i'll try to update this review as i uncover more positives and any negative experiences it was quite nice to get this from amazon at a price that the verizon store couldn't match the staff looked at me strangely when i showed them my amazon cart showing the unit selling at 199 getting the phone online was ridiculously easy charge the battery call my number from another phone and press a key phone activitation occurs turned the note 3 on and all was good to go keeping it simple is always the best way to go,positive
582,great device i'm an android and samsung fan and this phone just validated that for me call quality was improved from my nexus prime battery life is better the screen is beautiful the s pen is nifty to use i was daunted by the size initially but i didn't notice it after a few days of use a good cover to help your grip is definitely beneficial now other phones tend to look comically small funny how you adjust to it also watching how to tip videos helped me quickly learn how to best use the device this is my favorite phone in 15 years highly recommended if the features appeal to your preferences that is,positive
583,here's a note the galaxy note blows everything else out of the water a fan of the motorola droids i was little leery to make a change i first tried the newer galaxy s5 it was pretty much all plastic and felt cheap so i decided to try the note i did a lot of research and the note 4 for the price wasn't really worth the 299 especially with the note 3 at 99 for almost the same specs now only 1 beautiful display extremely responsive intuitive metal bezel feels sturdy gives a little heft but the phone is in no way heavy even better with go launcher i've barely used my tablet because the screen is so clear and just big enough to do anything i want many more features made me fall in love with the note 3,positive
584,samsung galaxy note 3 black 32 gb this is by far the best phone on the planet i replaced my samsung galaxy nexus with this phone the improvements are so vast it would take me all day to explain them and since i don't get paid for my reviews i'll just say this if you want a really good smart phone with a screen just slightly smaller than a tablet that can do just about anything you can imagine then this would be the phone for you but get it from amazon you'll get a better deal verizon wanted the same money for only the 16 gig version also as a side note samsung makes a smart watch that goes with this bad boy totally incredible technology,positive
585,great phone good price i am so glad i waited for this phone instead of jumping onto the s4 the display is phenomenal the s pen is an awesome tool i held onto my droid bionic for longer than i wanted to because i just wasn't that excited about the phones that were available having the unlimited data from vzw still i knew i'd be paying retail price to keep my data plan and wanted to make sure i waited for the right phone samsung did a great job and i personally am glad they did not jump the screen up to 6 inches for the note 3 the display size is perfect but any larger would be too big for a phone i waited to see how htc's one max would turn out i liked it's aluminum build but for me it just didn't have enough to challenge the note 3 thus i went with my first samsung phone it's fast feature loaded and i have a lot of fun with it best of all amazon price matched the phone to verizon's website price so i saved 100 and was able to use an amazon com gift card i had saved very glad i made this purchase with amazon,positive
586,i loved this phone when i first got it and almost i bought this phone once i saw that you can link up with verizon through amazon to do your upgrade i loved this phone when i first got it and almost two years later i still love it so much with how often i abuse this phone by randomly dropping it and whatnot it's a very durable and trustworthy phone when i upgrade again i'd love to go through amazon verizon again to get the newest version of the note,positive
587,great phone never going back to a non phablet again love this phone it is absolutely great the stylus is a godsend for writing quick notes and has a bad ass battery life works for 2 plus days and i drive through a buncha low signal areas the screen size is awesome and gives me tons of room to view emails and websites i can even run two side by side and read them easily the size is not an issue as i'm a pretty big guy with big hands but even my girlfriend 5'4 has one and loves her screen too she uses her stylus to type instead of her fingers mostly highly recommend this phone,positive
588,loved my husband's but not the one i received i loved my husband's phone which was the exact same model but the one i received via amazon is leaving me unimpressed i can hold it side by side with my husband's phone his picks up the verizon signal just fine while mine gets nothing same provider same settings same phone same location nothing it seemed to work fine when verizon first set it up for me and will ocasionally pick up a weak signal i lowered my rating after i read reviews from others that have experienced the same problem after installing the prompted system updates now i have no hope that it will get any better,positive
589,i am so happy with this phone i am so happy with this phone upgraded from a razr for the larger screen i have to say i am impressed with amazon they sent a separate email with activation instructions phone which took maybe 2 minutes immediate activation i am amazed with the capabilities of this phone the clarity of the screen is fantastic i live in a rural area and the reception is the same as my old phone i inserted my previous sd card and i am able to access everything it shipped with the 4 3 android os love it thanks amazon,positive
590,exceeded expectations i was really worried about how big this phone was i was coming from a google nexus 4 the note3 is awesome the big screen makes things really easy to read and makes the multitasking multiwindow feature really easy to use the stylus is accurate and the preinstalled sketchpad app by autodesk is pretty awesome it stays in my pocket well enough because it is so big i never worry about it falling out still getting a case though graphics processing power storage all more enough plus it accepts sd cards wonderful phone can't see wanting to get rid of this one any time soon,positive
591,broken charging port won't charge broken charging port otherwise in perfect shape edit 5 1 18 still won't charge via cable or transfer data even after a reset bought a wireless charger in the meantime and ordered a new battery if that doesn't fix it i will be forced to return it such a shame considering it was in great condition and i'll end up wasting my screen protector,positive
592,note 3 after having my previous phone stolen good times i didn't want to pay much for i switched from a samsung galaxy 5 to a galaxy note 3 after having my previous phone stolen good times i didn't want to pay much for my stupidity but if i had to do it again i would have opted for the note 4 because of the camera lens processing speed and application quality despite the additional costs i love the on screen writing and use it all the time to avoid the other text entry i get a lot of oh my god that's huge when i take the phone out but i also like the larger screen so i don't have to stress my eyes i will adopt the note 4 or the note 5 if it exists the next time i renew my contract very nice phone,positive
593,this is an excellent phone i could sit here and go through this is an excellent phone i could sit here and go through all the specs on the phone highlighting how it excels in almost every single one of them but i'm not going to do that i will tell you the phone is by far and away my tops of all time owning them i know the note 4 just dropped as well as google's new nexus but if you are looking for a better value price wise this is an excellent option,positive
594,awesome absolutely the greatest phone on the market puts the iphone to shame my son played with it for 30 minutes and within a week got rid of his iphone and got one of these the crystal clear hd display is unbelievable the s pen with the s note app is so easy to use and recognizes my awful handwriting flawlessly with no lag write a name and a phone touch contacts and it's there instantly in your contact list the 13 mp camera is great the smart touch lets me transfer photos to my wife's phone instantly by just touching the devices together the battery life is one of the most impressive features and is as good or better than the specifications claim you can't go wrong here get one and you'll be glad you did,positive
595,highly recommended it's going to be a while before i learn how to use everything this phone can do but it's still quite useable without any training at all it's just that it can do a whole lot more i love the size of it getting on the internet isn't an exercise in frustration with this phone you can actually read your emails and browse the web without eye strain this phone will definitely take me through at least the next 2 years of my contract,positive
596,good refurbishment works perfectly really clear screen best samsung model phone ever only problem the replacement bezel used in this refurbishment is even cheaper than original samsung one silver paint chips off even when in protective case,positive
597,wtc as of right now it's more of a paper weight not able to use at all with out sim card bought for prepaid phone looked at online was under the impression could switch it over from my galaxy 3 best value for price has under skirt to hide the goodshitch has no sim card,positive
598,i love it i'm a long time smartphone owner i've had the samsung galaxy note 3 for only a few weeks but i'm so glad that i purchased it it does as much to meet my needs as any tablet it is a phone also i've heard some complaints about its size but for me that is an asset that enables me with my senior citizen eyesight to be able to address all of the features built into the unit as well as maximize all of the features offered in the installed software,positive
599,wonderful i went from an old flip phone to this and although i still don't know everything it does need to take a class i just love it really love the note taking capacity with the stylus and being able to draw a diagram on occasion is really a plus and then print to my printer via bluetooth so much fun but it's made me a lot more efficient and the size it's like having large print everything perfect for people who can never find their readers,positive
600,glad i got this i like the big screen and so many smart features i've owned iphone for about 4 years and i got tired of its small screen even some of the apps on it are better that of iphone i also like how you can type and correct at the middle of a word which iphone does not allow also this phone is faster oh one important thing that i almost forgot is that you don't need to go through any program like itune to upload music and photos you can download directly from computer to the phone this phone is easier to use than i thought i like it very much,positive
601,best phone ever i couldn't have found a better price anywhere at first i feared that i was going to get a refurbished phone or a phone that had been slightly used and returned but i could tell it was brand spanking new everything worked beautifully and i haven't had a single problem with it it was shipped overnight free of charge and it was packaged very nicely and safe i get a signal where my friends and family members don't get one they have asked to use my phone when we've been buried deep within buildings and or basements,positive
602,good size for long fingers good size for long fingers extremely light and thin until the case that is great screen although washout is still a problem in the sunlight very nice photos strange tendency to fail to get phone signal after i leave my company wifi reboot fixes this call quality is ok but speakerphone is quite clear like that speaker is on bottom rather than back decent but not exceptional battery life,positive
603,maybe not as much as i love mine but a lot bought this for my wife who finally escaped from at t and moved to a family plan on verizon with me she loves it maybe not as much as i love mine but a lot as far as i'm concerned this is the best smart phone ever made period small enough to fit in a front shirt pocket but big enough for reading a kindle ebook using the app i've even signed papers for the faa using the stylus and sent them off just an amazing device,positive
604,horrible everything was good even though it was a used phone the phone was working perfectly fine until today i only had the phone for a week and the phone completely blacked out i have never dropped the phone and just simply put it inside my backpack and when i took it out to check the time the screen was completely blacked out on the inside and the outside looked fine with no scratches definitely wouldnt recommond to buy,neutral
605,loving this phone i just received my note 3 today and it is a w e s o m e its a lot to get use to but i'm up for the task i am using youtube to check out some hidden tricks that i am unaware of i gave 4 stars because the package came without my earpiece the colors and the size of the phone is amazing i switched from the samsung droid which drained the battery in 30 minutes the sound from the speaker is crisp and clear after holding the phone for a few hours it doesn't seem as big i will check in again after using for a few months,positive
606,awesome coming from samsung galaxy s3 this was a decent jump fits perfect in my hands i have been using this phone for several weeks now it is probably the best smartphone in my opinion as of writing this review i do dislike the crap ware built in by verizon cannot get rid if it unless one roots the phone battery lasts at least 2 days on moderate use,positive
607,love my note 3 i bought this phone used because verizon was being ridiculous i love it it was listed as used it only had like one tiny dent it looks basically new the phone works well it was cleared off all i had to do was insert my sd card it came with a battery and a charger it is quite good for the price hundreds less than new from verizon but works amazing i've had it well over a month and no problems yet it also came with the s pen for the phone,positive
608,my favorite phone thus far i love my note 3 it does everything well i have a new tab 3 and still prefer to use my phone for most tasks i could do on the tablet many people say its too big but i disagree i plan to upgrade to the next model when its available,positive
609,amazing phone amazing deal as an android enthusiast first having a droid x then galaxy nexus then that broke and went back to a droid x2 i also was an avid custom rom user this phone is amazing just perfect final thoughts love it best phone yet see below for more detailed thoughts pros blazing fast with the 3gb ram and quad core processor you will never run out of resources lte is blazing fast seems to turn on faster than huge screen with gorilla glass 3 you wouldn't believe the difference even from galaxy nexus with it's scratch resistant glass 1080p resolution enough said very long lasting battery with that 5 7inch screen you better believe it will suck down power the battery delivers you can root it it's a pain but it's doable camera is really nice custom built in camera and gallery apps are not as good as stock but still pretty good usb 3 0 they barely brag about this the usb 3 0 chord and charger that comes with the phone is amazing the phone will charge from 0 100 in like 40 minutes with the usb 3 cable transferring files is extremely fast with the usb 3 cable must have a usb 3 port which most new laptops and motherboards have usb 2 cables and chargers still work with it the charge is just a little slower don't freak out when you see the new male portion of the usb cable it's not proprietary it's usb 3 and it is still backwards compatible the right side of the usb 3 cable is the same as just usb 2 cons the bootloader is locked so i can't load custom roms the bloatware is annoying but it's to be expected nfc doesn't work with google wallet even rooted annoying but i think then are working on it from what i understand it's a hardware thing where the new nfc format isn't compatible s pen is useless for me waste of space in the handset i'm sure it's useful for some it's good for defacing pictures of people that you take final thoughts love it best phone yet i'll be glad to answer any questions,positive
610,the phone is way better than i dared hope for the phone is way better than i dared hope for several local sellers in the tampa bay area handle this style of phone but i loved amazon's 30 day back promise and felt much safer ordering through amazon and all this time i have spent looking for a replacement for my samsung note 2 i never once thought of amazon you guys rock,positive
611,one of my best buys one of my best buys i am a person who does not run to purchase a new trendy item i had held on to my old cell phone for many years and this year i decided to purchase a smartphone that could replace several gadgets palm mp3 player ereader etc this smartphone does that and more i also like the size of this phone it is large enough to enjoy without being too big or too little,positive

614,samsung galaxy note 3 is not to big i thought the phone may be to large for me but is just about right i had the samsung galaxy s4 and i was able to work it with one hand easily but the note 3 took a little more effort to get used to it has an option to change the layout of things for one handed use and that's good the display is awesome the battery life is excellent it still fits it my pocket too i like it and would recommend it,positive
615,good deal and a good phone great phone for the money even today i see people selling this phone for much more on craigslist facebook my phone came with nothing but a charger no factory box or instructions it is very large and hard to handle especially while driving but the screen is awesome i love the exterior feel and finish it is a shame to cover it up with a case but with a phone this big it will get dropped good deal and a good phone,positive

619,be there when it arrives i love this phone my wife can attest to me being hard to be satisfied with phone for the 1st week i said everyday did i tell you i love this phone today my only word of advice is to be home when it is delivered and be the one to open it so your 20 year old son doesn't open it while being helpful and break your stylus before you get home in his defence he immediately ordered a new one for me,positive

625,well done samsung well done this handset not only met my expectations but exceeded them samsung has really really upped their game since last i expweienced their smartphones i never likes the way they handled mms especially now this is as seemless as sms the group messaging has improved to the point of not nearly needing a separate app any longer and the multi tasking features have thoroughly impressed me,positive
626,love this phone purchased this smart phone for the wife she absolutely loves it she says that the screen is very clear it takes awesome pictures and it's easy to see she has a problem with the vision in her right eye but because of the large display she can easily see the text and pictures,positive

631,that aside this phone is great only thing i'm not fond of is the i'm never buying a phone off of amazon again they said i couldn't buy a second phone afterwards to add to the account that aside this phone is great only thing i'm not fond of is the outside bezel the chrome chips quite easily also if you need to replace the screen it requires pretty much the entire assembly to be replaced,positive
632,just put in my sim card and was good to go works perfectly just put in my sim card and was good to go,positive
633,excellent phone this is an excellent phone tablet for the discriminating buyer the picture is clear and vibrant and definitely large enough to see all tiny details no matter which webpage you are on i went from an iphone to the samsung galaxy note 3 and i am very glad that i made the change before the phone arrived i feared that it may be a little too large for me but it definitely isn't i would recommend this phone if you are looking for a great 4g lte device with a decent screen size for webpage browsing and a great high quality camera,positive

642,the screen is so easy to see i went from and iphone 5s to this huge galaxy note 3 the screen is so easy to see battery life is awesome my only complaint is the way it starts acting funny when the battery gets down to about 20 which doesn't happen much it doesn't respond as good if the battery gets to that low,positive

657,samsung galaxy note 3 black verizon wireless great phone great price i have to admit i am still learning about it my previous phone was not nearly as sophisticated so theres a learning curve for me but i'm having a blast p s the camera is awesome,positive
658,110 satisfied i searched for a phone for a while this is by far the best i've ever owned the screen is vibrant and a great size to view everything from movies to games the raw processing power is noticeable screen to screen transitions are smooth heavy apps load and run flawlessly the battery lasts for 2 or so days under moderate use even being inside a structure that prevents 4g 3g signal the phone is large but one handed operation is easy it even comes built in all in all i really have nothing negative to say i'm completely satisfied great job samsung,positive

672,what battery life after 6 days 37 battery remaining that's pretty amazing my last phone droid bionic lasted two days max alright i'm not a really heavy user i check email a couple of times a day i make 6 10 phone calls a day i do some web browsing when away from my desktop computer and run a few apps otoh i'm often connected to wifi at home or away bluetooth is off right now so that probably saves some juice what i miss from the droid was the availability of dedicated docks for car and desk but it would overheat in the windshield dock which i'm hoping won't happen with the note 3 one other negative i've noticed is the placement of the power button opposite the volume rockers i have to be careful to only press the power switch i'm a 6' tall guy and the size of this is not a problem i chose it as a way to have a single device rather than carry a tablet in addition to my phone carrying it in a pocket of a travel vest is no problem i think it would be too large to carry on a belt the camera seems to perform like a phone camera ok in good light only at a dimly lit party with flash on produced smeared images due to excess in device noise reduction love the size for browsing my calendar and email web browsing is better than on a phone but not really competition for a tablet just getting accustomed to the s pen and find it better than a conventional stylus have barely scratched the surface of the extra functions speaking of just scratching the surface i find that i'm going to have to set aside time to partake of some tutorials in order to really get the most out of the note 3 my first smart phone was a blackberry six years ago then i graduated to the droid bionic the power of this phone plus features of android 4 3 encourage me to learn to live up to what it can do since this is my only portable device i went for a sandisk extreme 64 gb microsdxc class 10 uhs i memory card which brings my total available storage close to 100 gb might as well be equipped to take maximum advantage of this beast,positive
673,absolutely love my phone absolutely love my phone this puts any phone i have owned or used to shame i will be upgrading to the note 4 instead of the iphone 6 plus due to how much i loved my current phone display is the perfect size,positive
674,but it is fun too it is not very loud and i it is a steep learning curve expecially for oldsters of diminishing capacity but it is fun too it is not very loud and i cannot really get the volume any higher no matter what i've tried,positive

687,pricey but great tech still learning how to use it honestly it is leaps and bounds above my old lg revolution fast powerful handles everything you throw at it but probably won't handle a lot of throwing like the old revolution could more delicate no gorilla glass great camera for video and pics also biggest issue is not being able to tether phone to computer via usb to work on files with so much storage available i have a 64gb card in addition to the 32gb on board i feel like its a waste and have to use google drive now which sucks data up very quickly overall the phone is what i expected other than the latter issue and i look forward to learning more about it,positive

694,screw any iphone 5 5c 5s there's a new bad boy out there called the note 3 if you are tired of an iphone which i'd imagine no one is sad because the iphone 4 to the 4s was a bigger leap from the 4s to any of the 5's why steve jobs sadly he is gone and apple will never be the same get the galaxy note 3 yes it does suck a little because you don't have seamless integration via other mac products guess what who cares this is a far superior phone and i could go into specs but just read the reviews because i'm too lazy to write them i had a 4s for two years then got the 5s and was disappointed to them max fix the freakin' aspect ratio you fools this is the third iphone 5 and they still fell flat pathetic truly unacceptable it's not even 16x9 why yep no steve jobs this is rudimentary and apple still doesn't get it unacceptable so i got the note 3 this baby will blow you away and if you get a wallet case cellto wallet case is awesome then it is not that bad at all to put up to your ear it begins to not feel like a tablet which is beneficial because this pretty much is a tablet too amazing phone proud of samsung for getting it together and delivering and then some love the pen as i am a filmmaker and just creative get it i realize most out there aren't tech save so have fun with your iphone the galaxy note 3 combines both worlds technicality and user friendliness don't believe or don't care have fun with an inferior phone and i love apple always have had both pc and mac computers but innovation will never match what steve jobs did for apple he laid out the blueprints for multiple devices to the world to expand on i guess apple didn't get the memo clearly they've reached their pinnacle and can only attempt to catch up to what was already handed to them again pathetic disappointing if you're serious in getting a great phone buy the note 3 if not get whatever the hell you want it will be inferior choose as you will to each is our own,neutral

762,great phone looking forward to the note 5 great phone looking forward to the note 5,positive
763,wow i purchased the note 3 after a good deal of consideration and research first off i should relate that i'm into computers i took my first computer course in 1972 fortran and have kept up with developments ever sence i built my own gaming general purpose rig and repair modify and troubleshoot computers i enjoy it i have been watching the development of cellphones with the same interest my first cellphone was a motorola bag phone remember those and have upgraded only when i saw a definite improvement in functionallity but never did so as a matter of fashion late last year i decided that it was time to replace my six year old lg dumb phone i also had become interested in buying a high end tablet after seeing some of my young in laws using theirs during the holidays i had the thought that it would be great if you could buy a nice tablet that also made phone calls of course nothing like that exists i then began taking a harder look at the high end phones after seeing a hsn show on the iphone and decided it was time to finally make the jump to a smart phone i concluded that the technology had matured to finally deliver the the functionallity that it promised and still be user friendly after much research i settled on the samsung i looked briefly at the s4 but felt it was to small to replicate the tablet experience that i wanted i'm a verizon customer no particular loyality they just happen to have the best service for my area so i went to the verizon store to check out the phone with a salesperson and maybe get a deal because they are so new there are no deals on the note 3 if you feel you can wait a year the phone will certainly be cheaper and in two years it will probably be free with a renewal upgrade verizon wanted 350 for the phone plus 30 to connect it they also charge a monthly fee for data use not the plan use that you contract for but just a fee to use data scam but what you gonna do i then went to my old faithful amazon they listed the verizon ready phone for 229 with no extra charges i went back to the verizon store and told them that if they couldn't match the price there was no way i could ignore a 160 difference they couldn't so i went home and ordered the phone i'm an amazon prime member as an aside if you order more than three things a year from amazon seriously join prime i ordered a forty inch tv for a christmas gift and it arrived in two days free wow and i got a notice that because of high demand my delivery would take a few extra days i thought no big deal i wasn't even really supprised when two days after my order the package showed up on my doorstep i opened the package and went through the basic setup i did have to call verizon support but they were very gracious about connecting and initializing the phone now about the phone this thing is amazing the closest approximation i can think of is a laptop the makes phone calls and takes really good pictures i am new to the whole smart phone experience as i indicated and have been constantly amazed by the functionallity capability and potential of the device i mean dual core processor 3 gigs of ram 96 gigs of storage with the expansion slot by way of comparison my first store bought desktop computer had an industry leading 45 gigs the android os is linux based so it has some subtle differences but not to the point of being a problem for pc users there is definitely a steep learning curve if like me you are new to the whole tablet smartphone experience it came with almost no user instruction other than initial setup i went online and found the samsung users manual and downloaded it 256 pages if you skip all the lawyer stuff in the front i also got a book on my kindle account free that also helps but i am convinced that like most electronic gizmos that are continuously developing by the time i figure out how to really use it i'll be ready for the next thing youtube is also a great resource for instruction on the phone and the various apps as to the apps if you order the phone from amazon it comes pre loaded with all the amazon apps and they cannot be uninstalled but why would you want to and because google owns the android os you are joined at the hip to google and all its apps and anoying behavior and no you cannot get rid of it i have used google since it first came out in beta but i find them rather spooky i'm sure the same problem or worse exists with the iphone one of the first things i noticed about the phone was the very poor battery life i was used to my old phone keeping a charge for days and i noticed i was only getting 5 6 hours of time on the note i researched the situation and found that you should perform a certain ammount of cleanup on the new phone built in utillities can accomplish this but the best solution is to download an app called all in one toolbox get it from the amazon appstore for free it is a highly regarded app and makes the list of top ten downloads consistently using the app's function of disabiling background resource hogs you can up your battery life to maybe a day and a half bottom line the note 3 is a battery hog so you can just count on keeping it on a charger when not using it the up side is that it charges fairly quickly physicaly the phone is large even for my 6'2 oversized hands i find myself constantly fumbling around when using it trying to find a comfortable position another problem is when shifting the grip on the phone i inadvertently press one of the soft keys and thereby change the screen annoying but something that i'm sure would be a problem with any phone and particularly with smaller phones i e s4 i just looked up and realized its 3 a m i thought this review would be about two paragraphs i'll try to add more impressions later bottom line this device is in its small way a life changer like i stated earlier a laptop that makes phone calls it's just a little too large and heavy with a protective case which i recommend to fit in a shirt pocket but i have no trouble finding a way to carry it and all those times in the past when i was away from home and i wanted to do something that required a computer and internet access and was frustrated are now history i guess i'm now a connected dude,positive

883,best phone i have ever owned this phone is literally the best phone i've ever owned samsung really hit it out of the park with this one the screen in absolutely amazing beautiful bright and bold this phone is so fast that snapdragon 800 really brings its a game everything is buttery smooth and i love it this phone is a powerhouse and i can barely put it down it feels great in the hand though the screen is bigger this phone is thinner and lighter than the note 2 i really didn't think i could love a phone more than my beloved note 2 but i was wrong full hd 1080p takes things to another level i paid full price for the phone and it was worth every penny samsung has won a new fan,positive

891,my favorite smart phone yet this is my favorite phone yet at first i thought that such a big phone would be inconvenient for me that was not the case at all i can't speak for everyone though and i would encourage anyone looking to buy this phone to look at it in the store and see what it feels like in the pocket etc the phone isn't tablets sized it's still just a big phone i have no problem putting it in pockets but i have big pockets what i really like about this phone is that it really blurs the line on what a phone is vs a tablet a kindle a portable game system this phone has no problem doing any of those things i can use full web pages not just the mobile versions i can read a book from the google play library or the kindle types very easily it plays plants vs zombies 2 minecraft pocket edition stuff like that the battery life is excellent you'll only get a few hours gaming but doing almost everything else you get quite a lot it charges quickly the screen is gorgeous the stylus is quite handy i find myself using it quite a bit i like the fact that it's attached into the phone making it difficult to lose there's a setting where the phone reminds you not to leave your stylus behind if you walk away all in all a great phone perfect for my uses,positive

916,great but i am giving this phone 4 stars because it is not gold on the sides like the ones at verizon i wish i would have known i would have spent the extra 20 at the verizon store this one is silver on the side not a big deal and i am more then happy with the phone itself you're gonna love it it's addicting,positive
917,disappointed received the wrong item,negative
918,good product a nice phone i like it a different felling with iphone 5 i think that it is time the iphone should enlarge their screen size,positive
919,love it i absolutely can't live without my note 3 now i had a note ii for several months and just had to have this one the advancements over the ii are like comparing regular unleaded fuel to racing fuel yes both will get you where you want to go but damn the trip is much more fun with racing fuel,positive
920,ok till someone stole it out of my handbag at ok till someone stole it out of my handbag at a party now i have to deal with verizon to cxl the service,positive
921,five stars if i could give this 6 stars i would,neutral
922,four stars a phone this expensive and no flash player minus 1 star,negative
923,good to great device if you don't care about the ui this phone phablet in reality should get a 5 the screen is absolutely fantastic the device though large feels great in hand the stylus with the quick actions that launch automatically and also when you push the button and air gestures works very well the phone's battery life is unreal i got easily 2 days worth fo use without charging and a solid day of heavy usage and the sd card slot is so underrated these days as well as the removable battery the leather back didn't look or feel cheap to me and the phone turns a lot of heads fid that's your thing it's definitely a step up from the note 2 okay so why didn't i give this phone a 5 or even a 4 according to the rating guideline a 5 is i love it a 4 is i like it well i liked it at first but never loved it but over the course of a week i ended up not really liking it i tried to give myself time to get used to the interface and it never happened i changed the launcher tried to tweak the settings even tried some themes ultimately it came down to the user interface is just awful the colors are not consistent between the different apps and settings the samsung touchwiz software and verizon stuff get in your way more than they help coming from a galaxy nexus the ui was just jarring to me i didn't care for the hard buttons either although that's just a preference the way the samsung framework is set up there's no easy way to enable on screen keys either overall i was just not happy with the ui and the ux also the screen ppi settings are wrong for a screen of this size everything is too big samsung could have tweaked it down a bit to make use of the 1920x1080 screen as it is you don t really get any more usable room in apps than you would in a galaxy note 2 the only places you'll really see the screen shine with pictures games web and video for me anyway all other apps seemed to be overblown because the ppi settings are wrong so i gave it a 3 because overall i think it's okay i ended up getting an lg g2 i like that phone a lot better the lg user interface is more customizable and doesn't remind you of old android but more in line with the new android 4 x user interface plus the g2 is capable of being flashed with cyanogenmod if that's your thing unlike the note 3 you don t have to give up the stylus to do that other features like air gestures eye tracking etc are just gimmicks to me anyway,positive
924,dislike it complicated and not at all intuitive compared to apple products i don't likeit but it does what i need it to do i wouldn't buy it again,negative
925,i really was reluctant to purchase a samsung device but then all that changed all right here is an honest review about the note 3 it's something that i will approach from the perspective of someone in the medical field who needs to get things done quickly and efficiently first of all i received my phone on october 10th and i had pre ordered it but did not pay 299 well initially i did but there is a promo code of verizon30 that drops the note 3 down to 209 99 i bought the note 3 for myself and the lg g2 for my wife needless to say at the price of 139 99 for the g2 and 209 99 for the note 3 we returned the g2 for the note 3 despite the g2's incredible low light camera performance here is why backstory prior to buying the note 3 i have had the droid razr maxx which for its time was a great device now that apps are becoming more memory intensive something needed to change i needed a phone that wouldn't lag on me and i really don't care about gimmicks such as scrolling while looking up or down or pausing a video if i look away who really cares about that stuff if i want to pause i tap on the screen which is less time consuming that looking away and ensuring my phone has paused playing a video in addition i really don't want that front facing camera on unless i am using it also i was always reluctant to buy a samsung phone because of the plastic build but you know i always keep my phone in a safe case i will talk about this a little later now right before i let go of my razr maxx i briefly upgraded to the note 2 for 2 days i chose the note 2 because i was in best buy and was comparing the htc one which best buy had on sale for 50 and all of a sudden i decided to listen to the note 2's speaker i was blown away in comparison to the razr maxx but blown away which how much more i got in comparison to the htc one we are all going to large screens now and frankly who the heck wants to hold the phone closer to their face i certainly don't so i upgraded to the note 2 i really did not fall in love with it until the day i was sitting in my senior human cadaver anatomy course and realized i had forgotten my anatomy atlas and my notebook i frantically searched the note 2 and found an app called s note i opened s note and began using it i was blow away there are blood vessels that are large and really thing and i used to be able to only differentiate that on paper not this time with the note 2 i was able to use the thin and thick lines as differentiators thanks to the s pen i then made my decision that i would return the note 2 and wait for the note 3 because of the larger screen and faster processor in addition i had a memory intensive anatomy app running on the note 2 that smoothly ran it when my hp touchpad running android decided to begin hiccupping now with all that said this is why i feel the note 3 is the best choice on the market first of all if your going to purchase a phone that you are spending your hard earned money on it it should be in the most secure and safest cases it's an investment that when 2 years later you sell back you can almost pay for your new device second of all we will all drop our phones at some point and its important to protect them i purchased the spigen bounce case despite it being slightly ugly i got the gray one because incipio ngp tpu cases are not yet available for this phone that case kept my razr maxx in like new condition now i really protect my phone because i have my entire life on it my class schedule my hospital schedule my family schedule my kids doctors appointments my appointments my tests etc everything so i needed a phone that was behind me 100 and never let me down it has been the case with the note 3 i have customized it and it still hasn't hiccupped yet now the actual review screen productivity the large display is fantastic it is large enough to hold a full month calendar on one home screen and 3 days on another i absolutely love the vivid screen because my anatomy apps as well as using it to take notes is an absolute breeze my only recommendation is to add many pages before you begin in lecture or whatever you want to take notes in there are many times where i find inspirational quotes on facebook fb and wish i could save them and tag them to share not via fb but text messages etc scrap book has allowed me to do just that i can share inspirational quotes and pictures with anyone and it's a breeze to look them up by placing my own personal tags for each photo i hold the menu button type inspiration and bam i have all my things that are tagged inspirational sometimes i also need a list of diagnostic medical conditions and it's easy to quickly create a scrapbook memo or create a flow chart in s note etc in fact the other day i was talking to verizon and needed to write down the conformational code etc for my second note 3 and you know what i did i was on the dialer page pulled out the s pen and circled the page then i notated it with all the information it contains the date the time and all the information i need to have in case something went awry i absolutely love this feature and it is very important another feature i love is that when i am on youtube i can load hd very quickly the lg g2 did a good job in this too but the razr maxx despite being an lte phone did not handle this very well another thing i really love on this phone straight out of the gate is that it tells me how many text messages i have like an unread count its something i like it also has many accounts built right in such as amazon facebook etc i was able to disable most of the bloat ware by going to manage applications and clicking disable in some of the pre loaded verizon apps the ir blaster is great i've already started using it on all my tv's however it wont turn the volume up on my lg tv but do every else in addition i am able to have in memory which room has which tv and so when i switch rooms i also switch rooms on my phone which allows me to use it as a remote great when you have to hide the remote from your little ones battery life used it for an entire day hardcore and its still at 31 at the end of the day after about 6 am to 1 am usage update 10 23 13 see the attached screen shot of battery usage i was pretty impressed i do know for a fact though that s health eats battery life like crazy also i love the speaker placement on the bottom of the phone because it's just smart when i hold my phone it cups around the speaker channeling the sound directly to me and not the entire audience behind my phone smart people have complained about the flip board app but keep in mind this is android and not ios we have choices here download an app called home 2 shortcut and it allowed me to configure double tapping the home button to start google now rather than anything else its fantastic and a great use of android capabilities i will update more here the s pen i received was faulty with my phone and so verizon sent me a brand new one for free not taking off stars for that during the pre order stage stuff like that happens every once in a while the spen was completely usable i just had to add a little extra pressure but no worries it's taken care of and all is well the power button has a slight lag when you just tap it to turn on the screen if you give it a robust tap it comes on quicker it is quickest to turn on the screen using the home button when it's sleeping it kind of irritates me that it is that way note 10 23 13 it maybe quicker to use the home button to do the same thing i wish samsung allowed customization of the led colors for the types of notifications note 10 23 13 re reception issues i know people have complained about reception issues but truly i haven't had many just a couple here and there i think the reality is that the note 3 is slow at switching networks etc so rather than wait i have just downloaded a refresh network app which does what i need in less than 15 seconds and gives me a fresh connection i don't see it as much of an inconvenience especially because the many positives of this device outweigh this one negative i haven't had no reception anywhere tethering by the has been pretty amazingly fast with this phone and it does not get hot i love that my razr maxx used to be a meteorite when it was tethering more to come update 12 13 13 i apologize it has been a while to update i absolutely still love this phone and i wouldnt change much about my review i will say that i have experience reception issues but they are sooo seldom i believe ive refreshed the network about 4 5 times since i have wrote the initial review and now ive been informed that there is an app that allows you to customize the colors of the led to what you want excellent so thats definitely a negative taken away i had been using my phone with a spigen screen protector and initially i liked it but now with using the s pen and it aging i really am beginning to dislike that screen protector i have just ordered a tempered glass screen protector and will update later about that one thing i have learned is to save everything from action memo to scrapbook or s note if you want to hold onto it in case your phone needs to be reset i had to reset my phone once but it was due to the foxfi app and it causing certificate issues once i reset it it fixed it another note the spigen case protector i was talking about it is great however i have found that the squared edges make it uncomfortable for my hand to hold when i remove the case i can handle the phone pretty easily with one hand even though i have hands on the smaller side so i have ordered a case that has rounded edges rather than squared edges whatever you do do not get a metal case for your phone because it will reduce your signal quality other than that the phone has been running great and i will update it again soon,positive
926,easy to see icons this is a smart phone that is easy on the eyes i haven't used all the features yet but i am looking forward to learning all that it can do,positive
927,my perfect phone i've been a fan of the bigger sized phones for some time and samsung has been paving the way in terms of quality large phones i remember when i had the 4 5in screened samsung infuse and it was considered large i've had a note and note 2 and loved both note 3 continues the tradition of keeping everything that worked improving where needed and adding features i wouldn't have even thought to ask so many of the little annoyances i had with my note 2 have been addressed its clear they put a lot of thought into finding out what people loved and wanted changed when i first held the phone i fell in love the form factor is just great and the screen is a noticeable jump up that's saying something when the note 2 already had a stellar screen resolution i don't feel the need to have this one in a case the slippery back of the note 2 required a case as i dropped it a couple times when holding it bare rather than go on feature by feature i'll suffice to say everything feels like a great and noticeable improvement s pen camera battery life screen on and on its the phone i loved before but better in every way i could have asked for i've tried dozens of smartphones over the past 5 years the note 2 was the first one i actually held onto for a year i easily see myself holding onto the 3 that much or longer depending on when they bring out a 4th i highly recommend this phone,positive
928,some advantages to this phone you might not have considered three things you might not have considered about this phone admittedly i'm an atypical cell phone user i don't actually make or receive a lot of calls probably because i was a very late adopter of the technology i was finally forced into buying one for a job that required it nonetheless i've been very happy with this phone here are three great things about it you might not have considered 1 it sounds fantastic i'm not referring to the quality of the microphone or speakers although they are pretty good for phonecalls but the amplifier used for playing mp3 and mp4 files with a good set of headphones music on this phone sounds great far better than it did on the ipod touch i was using before i bought this phone if you're an audiophile and rely your phone for portable music this is a great choice also the easily replaceable sd memory card means that you have the memory capacity to rip lots of songs at the highest bit rates 2 it seems almost waterproof twice i've accidentally immersed this phone completely in fresh water after opening it up removing the battery and all the cards as well as the s pen and drying it out it still works perfectly not that i'd recommend dunking your phone any longer than you have to maybe i've just been lucky 3 the battery easily replaceable has long life and charges incredibly quickly anyway some bonuses to buying this phone in addition to the beautiful big display and the stylus two of the main reasons that i purchased it,positive
929,two examples of this phone destroyed pictures from my sd card and more i was a very happy galaxy s 3 user so when it came time to renew i wanted another samsung here's every reason why that was a poor choice i'm going to say first that i had an insurance claim put on my first phone a four foot drop was enough to kill it completely and get a refurbished one and some of these problems happened on both first phone corrupted my sd card and cost me a lot of pictures second one magically 'disappeared' hundreds of pictures on my sd card they're also missing when i put the card in my computer to check so they really are gone second phone's wifi stopped working doesn't turn on after about two weeks second phone's pen stylus sensor has never worked has huge dead spots and spots where the cursor jumps all over the screen camera is garbage can't focus close usually quite slow to take a picture and has a green magenta hue when in low light this is consistent with both phones samsung's deviated enough from plain jane android that it's normal for apps to just not get along with this particular phone which happened when i had to move bank funds between accounts for a time sensitive emergency purchase and the app kept restarting comes pre loaded with a feel good galaxy note 3 instrumental song that will occasionally play by default when you go to play music over bluetooth to its credit battery life is still better than any phone i've had before overall this phone seems extremely poorly thought out as compared to my last one and i won't buy another samsung i'm going to get a third warranty replacement after this one's gone so wrong in terms of wifi and the pen stylus and before it can destroy any more of my pictures never again,neutral
930,note 3 still going strong no reason to upgrade i've had this phone for a couple years now it's still able to run everything all the latest phones can i see no reason to upgrade what it has over the current gen phones note 7 is 1 removable battery after a couple years the phone battery doesn't last as long i'm replacing the 3200mah batter with a 7500mah which will increase the life of the phone to twice as long try that with your note 7 2 removable microsd card i can keep upgrading the memory stick inside and actually have more storage than the current gen note phones 3 easily rootable sure samsung stops sending updates for the older models of phones doesn't matter because there is still a vibrant aftermarket for the note 3 operating systems rooting will also allow you to remove the bloatware that comes with most phones 4 cheaper accessories aftermarket larger capacity batteries cases screen protectors car mounts it's all cheaper because this is an older model phone and the demand has died down,positive
931,great phone bad camera i love android love it i am an apple user who just switched to android with the note 3 below are thoughts anyone buying should consider pros android really great display amoled technology is really awesome memory 32gb on board expandable with another 64gb stylus cons camera camera and the camera let me explain why i am giving this phone 3 stars when the only negative is the camera the camera performs very well outdoors in bright well lit areas the photos are crisp and clear no blurriness at all but if you dial back the light to the level of your average indoor room the quality takes a huge dive we have a 9 month old and i never get pictures anymore i used to have an iphone 5 it snapped amazing pictures all the time no matter what the lighting it has almost half the megapixels this phone has and yet the pictures are vastly superior bottom line if you don't want to miss shots indoors or don't want to have to have your subject hold perfectly still then look for another phone,positive
932,the best phone ever a class of its own if you're looking for a new phone and size is not an issue and you're not biased towards apple products don't think this is the best phone out there to get there's a reason why the current king of basketball lebron james is endorsing this phone it is simply the best phone tablet phablet mini computer entertainment gadget and reason why samsung has taken over apple the only reason i can see people not wanting this is the size or prefer ios over android software i used to be one of those people who thought it looked silly having a phone this size when the first note came out however with tablets becoming more prevalent and being extremely useful to have daily having a screen size this big is fantastic the size really doesn't make it an inconvenience at all as it is slim and easily fits in a pocket i can wear skinny jeans and the phone can still comfortably fit i use my phone a lot more now than my tablets this phone is loaded with features that even if size becomes a problem to you there is a one handed operation setting where you can adjust the screen smaller see tips below it's very useful i tried out the note 3 at an actual store and i was instantly envious and sold i could not wait for my upgrade contract to come upgraded from htc rezound my old phone my old previous phone was an htc rezound i could not stand that phone it would get hot just talking on the phone it was so uncomfortable putting my ear next to the phone the battery life was horrible i bought like 4 spare batteries for it and it would lag so much trying to make one simple phone call it gave me so much headache i had to upgrade right away i can't believe how sluggish my old phone really was as the note 3 runs smooth like butter the screen is gorgeous i can last an entire day with the battery and using it heavily the note 3 is a major breath of fresh air the note 3 really makes my old phone or any other phone look like a kid's toy phone despite the larger screen size it is still much lighter and slimmer the galaxy note 3 is a luxury first class experience with the powerful processor and 3gb ram it is smooth pros beautiful 5 7 super amoled capacitive large touchscreen great size and colors 1920x1080 runs so smooth fast processor and plenty of memory 3gb dual window screen you can watch youtube while browsing the web and whatnot processor memory is powerful enough to give you a nice experience it's like a mini computer does not get hot at all while talking this device doesn't break a sweat slim and light s pen is a great amazing feature exclusive to samsung you can draw notes and it can automatically convert it text you can do so much with this pen excellent battery life fast charging via usb 3 0 cable you can still charge using a micro usb cable but it also takes commonly available usb 3 0 cables for much faster charging cons when you double press the home screen it pops up my magazine app by default they should allow the user the freedom to assign that to something they want tips best way to take screen shots is using the s pen hold the side button on the s pen and then press down hold on the screen it will take a screen shot and allow you to edit the screenshot on the fly this is great for pointing out something on the screen or whatnot for sending quickly you can also take screenshots by putting your palm on the screen and swipe across like your hand is a scanner to do this you have to go to settings motions and gestures palm motion to on you can also hold on to the side button of the s pen and double tap the screen to open the action memo right away to make the screen smaller go to settings one handed operation use for all screens to on when you swipe quickly from exactly at the side edge of the screen so you would actually be feeling the silver sides across and then back out to the edge of the screen then it would shrink the screen if that explanation is confusing then just make a v motion swipe on the edge conclusion when it comes to screen size battery life features there's just really no comparison to the note 3 it is a league of its own the note 3 is future proof although it came out in september of last year 2013 newer phones that have come out after is still no comparison to the king note 3 the smaller verison samsung s5 was released recently this year but it has less memory 2gb and smaller battery life i also have a nexus 7 and nexus 10 but it is a pleasure using the note 3 and i use it more than the tablets now this phone is easily worth 5 stars and the price the galaxy watch also seems like a nice accessory to get especially if the price becomes more reasonable i'm aware the note 4 will eventually come out but i'm extremely happy to have this phone in my hands now instead of waiting months and using my old sluggish phone i'm certainly happy with the note 3 and i'm sure i'll definitely have a great experience with it until a note 5 comes out highly recommended powerful device in your hands worthy of the praise it gets from hundreds of people this phone will takeover your life and you would feel naked without it,positive
933,love love love it have owned it for several months i'd been looking forward to getting this phone since it first came out i've had it for several months now i can't think of anything i particularly dislike about the phone i love the s window so i can have youtube playing while i surf other pages the multi window function especially when researching stuff the battery life i have never had this phone die on me i am on the phone often both on calls messages and apps and have never had a problem it will warn me and i still have a long time before i need to plug it in the screen size it makes reading things especially as i'm long sighted far easier i find iphones and my old incredible2 comically small now the s pen i love screen shots action memo love that it works from the lock screen by using the s pen love the loop function where you can google or email or add to contacts or map etc anything you type watchtv app utilising the nfc near field communication so i can use my phone as a remote for my tv wave commands so i don't need to touch the phone i e when cooking so dirty hands to check the phone that it's water resistant it fell in the snow slush over winter and was undamaged that you can resize the screen to use it one handed if needed i have no problems with the size fits in my normal sized pockets without problem sound quality is fine as well i honestly cannot more highly recommend this phone the only thing would be that if you have small dainty hands this is not the phone for you i have large hands glove size and have no problem accessing both sides of the phone,positive
934,best phone ever this phone is great the large screen makes this one super easy to write documents and make notes the s pen helps to get stylus required jobs done like drawing the best feature in my opinion is the 4k camera basically it can replace most point and shoots great videos and definitely great pictures the flash works great too you can take google street view like images and they are amazing all cameras should do that most google play store apps will work unless they require kitkat or higher it runs 4 2 ice cream sandwich definitely buy this one was a great pick,positive
935,great phablet phone tablet combo but this is a great phone and tablet with all the features you could possibly want i wear it in a less than 5 from amazon sun glass type case on my belt and the fit is perfect but like many other users i was having a serious issue with the wifi dropping out frequently i tried all the recipes on the web and none worked thanks to a lead on the xda developers forum i just stumbled on the answer that works here turn off the bluetooth that is all it took to restore stability to my wifi samsung needs to fix this,positive
936,excellent fast phone great camera good battery life i adore this phone i've never actually loved a phone but i do love this one by far the most expensive phone i've ever owned in fact the most expensive electronic aside from my work desktop computer and slr camera but price aside this phone is awesome i love the responsive huge screen the photo quality is spectacular and i love the 2 app at once option which allows me to have two active apps open on the screen at the same time drag and drop urls to emails anyone this phone is practical light weight fast as can be easy to use the size may be a bit unnerving to begin with but i find it very comfortable it the hand i picked this phone because i was initially leaning towards the nokia lumia 928 for photo quality but being able to go with a big android with a stable system easily comparable photo quality the 2 app thing this was a no brainer the great battery life and the speed with data are added bonuses i use my phone more as a tablet half the time than as a phone and this one is really great for that i also find that for whatever reason the screen is easier to see in daylight than my prior phone i am sure there is a technical reason for this but i dont really care so much about the why as to the fact that it's excellent i am recommending this phone to all my friends and thankful to the friend who insisted i give it a try,positive
937,powerful smartphone that is always reliable huge improvement over previous note 2 i had several s4's with problems and switched to note 2 which was a bad idea not a good phone lots of problems so i almost didn't get another note but the note 3 is 10x better than the previous model display looks great not much lagging freezing at all multitasking abilities are really good along with several new s pen features i have had this phone for 3 months now and still am finding new features i didn't know about gps signal is good wifi never gives me problems and the camera is a lot better than note 2's it's hard to find a phone with lots of great features that also works without problems,positive
938,camera only so so phone audio only so so screen awesome i want 2 main things in a phone as good a camera as i can get and a screen that allows me to read screen is great the picture is great reading is excellent and the stylus is a bonus i use it sometimes but not as often as i thought i would i do draw with it sometimes and also make notes helpful but not completely necessary i like that it stores right in the phone though the camera is better on the iphone 5 heck the camera was better on my iphone 4 there is no macro at all so you have to be pretty far away to focus there is no low light i mean none you have to use the flash which is only so so or you have to just not take the picture same situation my husband will take the picture with his iphone 5 it will come out so if a camera is your main focus choose an iphone the audio quality is also not great when played on speaker music or speaker phone audio book it is fine but when talking on the phone the quality is less than stellar it is hard to hear volume could go higher because it does not come through as clearly as it had on my old iphone 4 or on my husband's iphone 5 same network same people i'm talking to so i've tested and it is actually this phone also it does not fit in a normal sized pocket and falls out so consider this when purchasing if you carry a bag all the time that's great but if not do you have pants or a jacket with very large pockets if no you will have to carry it all the time also in an evening bag it is hard to fit i was at a wedding last weekend and carried it separately overall i love to read on my phone and it is amazing for that i text almost all the time also amazing for that and when you do get good pictures the viewing and editing on this phone is great you can also draw over your pictures with your stylus which is fun and silly and amazing so i do love this phone but wish the camera was better the sound quality when i talk on the phone is livable,positive
939,best phone note 3 on the best network verizon having the best phone as of the date of this review on the best network love or hate verizon no one can deny that the coverage is just there when and where you need it with an unlimited data plan means that productivity will always be had with this device coming from the note 2 which i had for a couple of months before i sold it to someone coming from a htc thunderbolt suffice it to say he loves life too the full hd 1920x1080 1080p on this device improved s pen improved s voice it's cute but i would rather use google voice search what isn't there to love about this phone yes there are people who will cry about the size to those i say the market is dictating that cell phone makers go big or go home i have big hands and i can tell you that it feels good to have something in my hand s that won't feel like it'll break cell phone quality is excellent the build is more sturdier than the note 2 there were people crying about a loose home button but that wasn't in mine i buy that defects could happen but those are exceptions not rules in regard to the note 3 my phone is currently awaiting a wallet case that experienced problems but right now is housed in a ventev case which i reviewed and a spigen ultra crystal screen protector full screen and i'll review that too but buy it really protects the phone surfing the web reading e mail streaming music from google play on high and no cache because i got unlimited data d the phone does it all with such speed but the best part i love that beats the note 2 hands down battery life i have had this thing for a week and so far the battery last a good day and half to 2 days before i even see a low percent i have not used the microusb 3 0 cable that came with the note 3 because honestly the million and one usb chargers with 2 0 cable do a great job charging my phone all i would have done was open up yet one more usb cable so i have left that in the box bottom line buy this phone it is the best phone on the market and it will be well over a year before this phone becomes old full hd microusb 3 0 3 gb of ram 32 gb internal space coupled with the 32gb i stuck in there from my droid charge and much much more i could have written a more technical review but you want to know how my experience is overall and i'm telling you i have never been so happy to early adopt a device i hardly ever do it but i am glad i did you will too,positive
940,best value for money my favorite device of all time there are plenty of things i would change slightly but way fewer things than i'd change on my ipad desktop or any other phone i truly love this device it's so easy to use i use it 5 times more than any other phone mostly for games audible books on tape taking notes shooting pictures and more i have always wanted one device to carry and this is the only device designed well enough that i truly only need one device i sometimes connect it to my ipad bluetooth keyboard if i want to type that's the one thing i still need a laptop for ease of rapid typing,positive
941,love mine upgraded from a cracked screen note ii before giving my opinion and experiences with this phone i want to start with some advice if you are upgrading from another android phone search samsung's site for an app called samsung smart switch it's free and easy if you find issues with that app for any reason you can move all of your text messages from your old phone to this one by loading a free app called sms backup restore and following the directions i outlined in my november 30 2013 review of that product another free app you may want to consider is software data cable which allows you to back up your old android phone to a laptop or pc then move it to your new phone from that backup you will need to load that app on your old phone and the note 3 but it's simple and very handy while the size difference between this and the note 2 is only a matter of inches the screen on this one is brighter has more vivid colors and can be easily viewed in direct sunlight the 32gb of internal storage is a big plus because the 16gb on my note 2 was beginning to get full when i added in my 64gb external sd card i swapped from the note 2 total storage comes to 16gb more storage than my 80gb laptop it's easy to forecast that the next version of this phone could finally wean me off computers as it is i am spending a lot more time on my phone doing stuff i use to do on my computer this is also a much faster phone i do not use it to anywhere near its capacity but it zips along from one screen or app to the next with no lag i was more than pleased with my older note 2 but this one is even better i take a lot of pictures and video so i appreciate the greatly improved camera resolution and the easier and more intuitive interface but what i truly love is there are no major differences in the user interface even though this one runs under android 4 3 versus 4 1 2 on my note 2 in that respect there was zero learning curve after tweaking a few settings that did not come over when i restored my old ones i was up and running as before in practically no time this ships with a cable that supports usb 3 0 and has what looks like a connector that is incompatible with existing micro usb chargers that is not the case you can still use existing chargers battery packs and the such because their micro usb connectors will plug into one side of the charging port if you have a computer capable of usb 3 0 your transfer rates will be lightning fast the battery is about the same as the note 2 for use time between charges since the note 3's 4 3 android operating system does include bluetooth low energy ble support you may notice a slightly improved use time if you use bluetooth a lot as it stands there is a very slight difference between the note 2's 3100mah battery capacity and the 3200mah one in this phone i am still exploring the nuances of my new phone so as i discover noteworthy features that i have missed or emergent problems that i should warn about i will update this review to reflect them in the meantime if you are considering an upgrade to the note 3 from the previous model and are wondering if it's worth it i say yes,positive
942,great phone great battery life ignore 1 star review the galaxy note 3 is a great phone with great battery life and features the screen is big and beautiful the apps and features are great and the battery lasts a long time i have used the phone pretty heavily through a 12 hour shift and still had 40 left at the end of the day don't let the one star review fool you any apps you do not want can simply be disabled and the magazine app that is brought up by double tapping the home button can simply be disabled by checking a few boxes no registration necessary going into the app settings and unchecking the option for the home button leaving a one star review for something so simple to change to your liking is absurd this phone is also slim and light back cover is a nice feeling faux leather and the phone is built to last,positive
943,great phone but has some setbacks from note 2 overall this is a great phone the resolution is second to none and the battery life is the best i've ever had on a smart phone additionally the touch interface is very responsive more so than the previous note 2 moreover it is also quicker than the note 2 when bringing up apps and running apps but there are a few things that the note 3 lacks in that the note 2 had one is that although the camera for the note 3 is 13 megapixels and the note 2 8 mega pixels the note 2 seems to take better quality pictures further the note 2 had better low light visibility in the pictures as well and the camera view point seems to be more zoomed in at the furthest level from zoom on the note 3 making me have to take a few steps extra backward to take a picture that i wouldn't have to do with the note 2 secondly the video quality in low light lacks adjustment that the note 2 had in the note 2 one could take a video without the flash and still decipher whats in the video pretty well but in the note 3 even in a slightly dim room you cannot see what is going on in the video which makes talking videos from the phone quite frustrating i don't know why samsung took a step back on the camera on the note 3 by taking away lowlight settings and replacing it with a auto adjust feature on the camera that is supposed to adjust to the different light conditions on its own which it does not do very well might i add but with that being said the camera is not horrible its rather on the better side of smart phone cameras another thing is the speaker phone isn't as loud as the note 2's that was something that i really enjoyed on the note 2 overall though the phone is probably the best phone i've ever had and i've had the iphone 4 4s and 5 along with the note 2 the visual aspect of the display is awesome and the default storage is 32 gigs with additional 64 gigs addable storage potential and i appreciate the fact that one can take the back off and replace a battery or get extra batteries to charge on the side and replace when needed in the end i'll rate the phone a 9 10 the only complaint being the camera functioning,positive
944,love it yesterday i purchased the note 3 and galaxy gear i'd really debated on the gear but went with it and overall i'm happy with both items i bought the note 2 in december 2012 and it was an awesome phone i'd spent about 10 years with blackberry and then went with the razr maxx and its stupendous battery life the note 2's battery life isn't even close to the droid other than that i loved it and really loved the s pen i'm retired so i used the pen for grocery lists notes quick phone s and the like but after an update a few months ago my keyboard began to lag even samsung didn't know what to do and i was frustrated when i heard about the 3 i began researching and reading reviews yesterday i went to verizon and traded up my note 2 to a 3 i set everything up last night and have explored some new features i didn't think i'd even use but i saw i will love them magazine is one new feature i've become a news junkie and this brings up some things i'd not find anywhere else i am going to love the scrapbooking function i can easily copy and save quotes as i'm prone to do the battery life seems very good i took the phone of the charger about 9am it's almost 6 and i still have 69 remaining i've played some angry birds and i've had the bluetooth on all day i'm not a person who uses bluetooth much but it's been on because of the galaxy gear which at this time has 77 remaining the note 2 would be well below 50 by this time without the bluetooth the galaxy gear is simple to use it's pretty intuitive my only dissatisfaction is the sort distance between the note 3 and the gear needed to keep connected i'd hoped to be able to go upstairs without my phone but the bluetooth disconnects same for a short trip to the kitchen i keep the volume and notifications on vibrate my wrist easily feels the vibration since i can't be far from the phone i'd hear it ringing anyway what i can't understand is the carriers not having cases for the phone i've ordered a case from amazon until otterboxes are in finally i know some people don't like phablets i do more texting than phone the phablet is convenient i do a lot of facebook from it and other web browsing i do all of my gaming from it i use it to read ebooks in bed if i had to give up all of my devices but one the one to keep would be the note i have had virtually every tablet as well as most of the nook and kindle ereaders so this is saying something well done samsung,positive
945,hands down best phone out i left my 5s because i was sick of the exact same thing as every other iphone i hated the screen size on the iphone so i decide to get myself this gem of a phone great call quality beautiful display and android os this phone simply smokes the iphone now that i have gone android i will never go back to an iphone the phone does everything buy it you will not be sorry i bought mine outright for 764 dollars and it was worth every penny,neutral
946,long term awesome i've had this phone for 3 yrs it is awesome still today keep in mind to run apps that shutdown background apps and clear cache etc i keep mine in an otter box so still no cracks this phone is super fast with an excellent screen i run the most cpu demanding games and have several of them i run a 64 gig card so a total almost 100 gigs on this phone never any issues my gf uses an s7 and i still like the note 3 better real talk,positive
947,took back and got iphone 5s i was really excited for this phone when it came out and wanted to switch from the iphone 5 i was just kinda disappointed it was a really nice phone but some the things made me mad one of which was the volume control in the music player and pandora there's not way of turning it off and it made it impossible to play music in my car i'm just really not a fan of the android system either it's really buggy and just not secure the nicest feature of the note 3 is the s pen it is super easy to use and comes in handy the note 3 also has great battery life too i eventually just took it back and got the iphone 5s i haven't been disappointed one bit i did a jailbreak and it's able to do anything the note 3 can do,neutral
948,galaxy note 3 needs little introduction i would rate it above the iphone for many reasonsthe larger hd screen the much better android operating system and the start of the art cpu which has speed and precision great connectivity call quality super camera and great memory watching you tube and movies is fun the sound quality is super overall i would say this is the best smartphone in the market,positive
949,best phone i have ever owned this phone is great the screen is large and crisp making movies and photos look amazing the processor is fast making the 4g on verizon load as quickly as my home wifi for it to be so large the phone is quite thin and light so far the phone has been able to handle anything i throw at it i use it as my portable sketchbook the only con i have is samsung's my magazine feature that keeps popping up when i accidentally hold the home screen too long or swipe from the bottom of the screen it's very annoying as i do not use it,positive
950,my first smart phone evah this is my first smartphone and i'm pretty happy with it pros micro sd card 64gb option big screen cons why not 2 sd card slots why bloatware why have a pen i ordered this phone on amazon but 5 days passed and they never shipped it so i picked one up at verizon,positive
951,awesome phone i got this phone and just love it i wish it had less blood ware using the memory but still this is one amazing phone i seen people complaining about the gps but no problems so far i got the nexus 5 but you can't compare this two i think in this case you get for what you paid and the note 3 is totally worth it,positive
952,seems a bit large at first but i have gotten used to it large phone borderline tablet which is why i bought it if you are like me and use your phone for the same things you use your android tablet for you will adore this phone i was impressed how fast this thing is compared to my two year old htc rezound i also have the cover with the window in it which is a must have if you pocket carry like i do,positive
953,i been wanted this ph i want get this phone went it first came out and now i have it going on three week now i really like it all do lately it had been getting hot on me went talking on it the last 2 or 3 day anyone else have this issue it till new have not had it a month yet but i do like what it can do a lot till figure stuff out it after i have had it a couples of months i will write again,neutral
954,make a great phone greater and do yourself a favor make a great phone greater and do yourself a favor aug and tech armor ballistic glass screen protector done no worries,positive
955,i love it but edited this is a fantastic phone fast beautiful screen fun to use s pen etc so i'm giving it 5 stars because imo it is the best phone out there right now but i have small hands and my hand does get a little achy from holding the phone for a longish length of time i knew going in that this is a big phone and that's what i wanted because it's tough to read web pages and emails and watch tv via slingbox on small screens the back of the phone has a faux leather cover that makes the phone a little bit less slippery the back cover is very thin too which helps make the phone alot thinner than you'd think it would be given its size i just compared it to a friend's iphone and this phone is actually thinner some people have rated this phone lower simply because they don't like the plastic back cover to me i couldn't care less what the back cover is made out of since i will be using a protective case anyway i love to draw and the s pen makes it fun to doodle and even write with although the phone has a setting where you can make the screen more sensitive so you can use the touchscreen even with gloves on i will use the s pen instead because it's more precise there are so many features on this phone that i still haven't figured most of them out yet after all i just got the phone yesterday those who have a galaxy s4 will already be familiar with a lot of the features of the note 3 it comes with the usual verizon bloatware but you can remove the icons from your screens but not remove the programs from the phone itself you can disable them too this phone packs 32gb of storage plus you can add an sd card if you have lots of music pictures and videos that you want to store on your phone so no worries for me regarding the space that the bloatware takes up my last phone had 8gb of storage and i never used that up even with the bloatware if you are new to later android versions you may be surprised to learn that you can no longer store programs apps on the sd card which can be worrisome if you have less than say 16gb of internal storage and you like to have tons of apps on your phone edit this phone comes with android 4 3 i've just discovered that it does in fact allow you to save some apps on the sd card even so this phone has so much memory i will be hard pressed to use most of it so far all my favorite apps work great on this phone except for hbogo and maxgo 2nd edit hbogo has been fixed and it now works still waiting for max go to be fixed for now i'm happy that my slingbox works with this phone because of its size this phone is not for everyone but if you don't want to lug around a tablet but still want a screen you can see easily and use as a phone too then this is your best bet,positive
956,poor battery life i bought this phone at costco as opposed to amazon but i wanted to make a quick note warning to anyone looking to purchase this phone the battery life after the latest android update 4 4 2 is absolutely terrible the 'android system' takes up about 10x as much battery as it used to and dominates the battery consumption as opposed to the 'screen' which used to dominate consumption as it should even after installing battery doctor putting the phone on power saving mode it's still significantly worse than before when i did not need these options it is purely a software issue but an enormous one the screen is otherwise nice and the phone is responsive but expect an enormous battery drain such that your phone will not last a single day on a charge whereas prior to android kitkat it could go over 2,neutral
957,my hopes were too high for a used phone it's a decent phone if you don't have any type of service on it once you add the service get a pen and paper cuz the list of problems is quite long i have absolutely no bars and when i do i still can't get any text messages no calls it's a glorified mini tablet at best this may just be the phone i was given i hope those of you ordering afterwards have better luck,positive
958,got white one and so pretty love it i drop this phone maybe more than 200 times without the case and no break what so ever not like my previous i phone screen best phone ever btw i got white one so pretty and thin,positive
959,very pleased with this phone upgraded from a note 2 first off if you are upgrading from another android or even an apple phone here is some advice you may find useful search samsung's site for an app called samsung smart switch if for some reason that app fails you move all of your text messages from your old phone to this one by loading a free app called sms backup restore and following the directions i outlined in my november 30 2013 review of that product another free app you may want to consider is software data cable which allows you to back up your old android phone to a laptop or pc then move it to your new phone from that backup you will need to load that app on your old phone and the note 3 but it's simple and very handy i'll attempt to not parrot the excellent and informative reviews that have already been posted i do want to share my experiences with this phone and the ease of moving from the note 2 to this model the first thing i noticed is despite the small differences in size the screen on this one if brighter has more vivid colors and can be easily viewed in direct sunlight that alone made my upgrade worth it a second thing is this is a faster phone i do not use it to anywhere near its capacity but it zips along from one screen or app to the next with no lag i was more than pleased with my older note 2 but this one is even better having 32gb of internal storage is a treat especially since i have a 64gb external sd card to augment it that comes to 16gb more storage than my 80gb laptop so it's easy to forecast that the next version of this phone could finally wean me off computers as it is i am spending a lot more time on my phone doing stuff i use to do on my computer i appreciate the greatly improved camera resolution and the easier and more intuitive interface but that is icing on the cake what i truly love is even though this one runs under android 4 3 versus 4 1 2 on my note 2 there are no major differences in the user interface in that respect there was zero learning curve after tweaking a few settings that did not come over when i restored my old ones i was up and running as before in practically no time while this ships with a cable that supports usb 3 0 and has what looks like a connector that is incompatible with existing micro usb chargers that is not the case you can still use existing chargers battery packs and the such because their micro usb connectors will plug into one side of the charging port if you have a computer capable of usb 3 0 your transfer rates will be lightning fast with respect to battery the note 3 is about par with the note 2 for use time between charges since the note 3's 4 3 android operating system does include bluetooth low energy ble support you may notice a slightly improved use time if you use bluetooth a lot as it stands there is a very slight difference between the note 2's 3100mah battery capacity and the 3200mah one in this phone i am still exploring the nuances of my new phone so as i discover noteworthy features that i have missed or emergent problems that i should warn about i will update this review to reflect them in the meantime if you are considering an upgrade to the note 3 from the previous model and are wondering if it's worth it i say yes read the other reviews for other perspectives and information too because combined there is a high level of customer satisfaction,positive
960,my perfect phone i've been a fan of the bigger sized phones for some time and samsung has been paving the way in terms of quality large phones i remember when i had the 4 5in screened samsung infuse and it was considered large i've had a note and note 2 and loved both note 3 continues the tradition of keeping everything that worked improving where needed and adding features i wouldn't have even thought to ask so many of the little annoyances i had with my note 2 have been addressed its clear they put a lot of thought into finding out what people loved and wanted changed when i first held the phone i fell in love the form factor is just great and the screen is a noticeable jump up that's saying something when the note 2 already had a stellar screen resolution i don't feel the need to have this one in a case the slippery back of the note 2 required a case as i dropped it a couple times when holding it bare rather than go on feature by feature i'll suffice to say everything feels like a great and noticeable improvement s pen camera battery life screen on and on its the phone i loved before but better in every way i could have asked for i've tried dozens of smartphones over the past 5 years the note 2 was the first one i actually held onto for a year i easily see myself holding onto the 3 that much or longer depending on when they bring out a 4th i highly recommend this phone,positive
961,love it great item missing the cord by other than a great phone for the price would do business again,positive
962,best phone i have ever owned hands down this is by far the best phone i have ever owned hands down everyone needs to ignore the one lone one star review he is an abnormality who may have connections with competitors make sure to get a good case though speck cases are the best but they don't have one for the 3 yet bummed about that,positive
963,stay away from galaxy note 3 so i got this phone using verizon edge program ordered over the phone when i received it it wouldn't activate the sim card number wasn't on the order i had to pry the sim card out of the note 3 which is not an easy thing to do i had to do this to read the sim card number to verizon wireless so they could activate it i noticed that when i had device on maximum brightness not on automatic and was working on something over extended amount of time the brightness would dim for a few seconds then return to max this would keep happening at random intervals and to seemingly random brightness levels if i continued still to use it say after 45 minutes or something it would dim to minimum brightness for few seconds now it wouldn't show me or tell me in any way what brightness level it was changing to i could just tell when it was putting to minimum brightness i got it replaced for another note 3 the replacement had same issue i called verizon wireless and then they revealed to me that this was a feature built into device by the manufacturer i even spoke to samsung to verify this so stay away from the galaxy note 3 at all costs anyone that owned this device might need to operate the device on maximum brightness for extended amount of time i mean why have a long life battery quad core cpu and 3 gb ram if you can't fully utilize them so this phone does this to prevent overheating why would a 700 phone have a problem with overheating stay away from the galaxy note 3,negative
964,awesome i was very happy when i got this in right when i order it,positive

967,nice features but poor low rf signal reception i just purchased the samsung galaxy note 3 from a local verizon store i am very disappointed with this phone i paid full price to keep my unlimited data alive i am finding that the rf reception is abysmal in buildings where i used to get 89 dbm with my motorola droid bionic i get 118 dbm with the samsung galaxy note 3 even outdoors with the samsung galaxy note 3 i don't get that great of a 4g lte signal the phone will usually then switch to 1 to 2 bars of 3g and stay there until i am back in a really strong 4g area i'm thinking either the antenna is of poor quality or the radio is not very sensitive or both i may have to return this phone and try the lg g2 this gn3 cannot even begin to compete with my old motorola droid bionic when it comes to holding on to a less than perfect signal in strong signal areas there is no problem but when the signal isn't the best the gn3 does a poor job of holding the 4g lte signal my motorola droid bionic used to do an outstanding job in the same exact places this gn3 fails the screen is brilliant and you couldn't ask for a more feature packed phone the sound quality is good and volume level is great but above all the gn3 has to be able to connect to a signal to be a great phone in the near future verizon is going to voice over lte volte this means that our phone conversations will now be carried on the 4g lte band that really scares me with my gn3 since it can't maintain a 4g lte signal unless i'm really in a strong signal area,positive
968,five stars aaa,neutral
969,yuck yuck yuck this is one of the worst phones ever bought new in jan 2014 by march i was on my 4th replacement phone it wouldn't recognize the power cord that came with it they shut themselves off sometimes let text messages in or out depending on how the phone is feeling best part was when they started freezing this is my fourth phone i will not ever get another ever again,neutral
970,vverizon poor custermire support vverizon poor custermire support low rf signal gain i would have 86 on my droid i would have 118 on my note 3 icannot even use it in my home i have no had no other problems with verizon phones in my house for 19 years if you do not mind dropped calls all the time on this phone it is for you lot ofsamsung bloatware the screen is very nice but i never use the pen,neutral
971,easy simple and you feel like being a happy free this is just ridiculous the phone is locked to verizon and you can't use it with any other mobile service even if you get the full priced one no contract this is absurd t mobile part european company gives you full power over your phone you buy a phone from them and on your request you can unlock it by sending you an email code easy simple and you feel like being a happy free customer who can make his own cognitive choice now these companies verizon at t want to treat you like a child who can't make up his mind they want to lock every single aspect to never leave them this is ridiculous i called verizon specialists many times and each one has its own version of the story one guy told me you don't have to worry your phone will work with any sim one lady was trying to figure out what unlock means she thought my screen was locked then she put me on indefinite hold one told me you can use it internationally but within us it's locked so within the same company no one seems to know what's going on in their own space ludicrous so avoid buying any phone except if it's international or t mobile then you have your freedom to use it anywhere the phone samsung note 4 is awesome i will get it sooner than later but i am sad i had to return the phone to amazon i want a note 4 so bad,positive
972,and my life is so freaking complicated by the difficulty of doing what with 'older' technology used to be so easy i tried to ge i have always just plugged any of the last half dozen droid phones or windows phones into a cable to a usb port on my computer and directly transferred files to and from be the pics songs or anything else now i have a samsung galaxy note 3 and my life is so freaking complicated by the difficulty of doing what with 'older' technology used to be so easy i tried to get help and was told samsung doesn't make it easy they just make it techi i believe it the days of my having this 3 month old samsung are going to end i checked into turning it in for a partial refund and guess what it is worth 0 zero ziltch nada geezzz i'm so surprised i will never own a samsung again,neutral
973,really disappointed with this phone i have had this smartphone for a few months now and i continue to be disappointed with how buggy and unreliable it is i constantly have problems getting the phone and headset features work consistently also the phone is a power hog even with the large battery i have constantly having to turn off features like wifi bluetooth gps etc when not using them or i have no chance of getting through the day on one charge when the battery does get low below 5 the phone has to be powered off to charge or it will shut itself down even if it is connected to a charger one of the most irritating features is that you have to enter your password to turn the phone ringer on or off i do like the large screen but that is about the only thing i like about this device i will be moving back to an iphone when they release their larger screens later this year,neutral
974,purchase insurance i was excited to purchase this device since before it came out i did a lot of research and waited quite a few months before upgrading from my galaxy s3 initially i was satisfied with the device 10 days after purchasing the device however i am stuck paying more money to replace it normally i do not purchase insurance on devices and luckily the phone company put it on without asking me i did not drop or put any excessive pressure on the phone to damage it i set the device on the counter and when i picked it up a few minutes later the screen was malfunctioning having 14 days to take it back to the provider i tried that first i was informed that there was a pressure crack in the lcd and that apparently i had caused it knowing that i had not done anything to cause it i became very upset i was told that i could send it to the provider but if they determined that the phone was damaged i would have to pay full retail for the replacement refurbished device they replaced mine with the other option was paying the 100 deductible for my insurance and not knowing exactly what was wrong with the device i turned to samsung to solve this delima they looked at the phone and determined the lcd was cracked said that i caused the damage to the device and it would cost over 200 to repair now i have a device that i did not damage and must pay an insurance deductible on to replace i asked how to file a complaint with samsung about this and they said i cannot after further researching this specific issue i have found that this is actually a common issue with this device it can actually occur due to temperature changes in the device that are considered normal operating temperatures i have to note that i loved my galaxy s3 it was why i stayed with a samsung device i was even considering buying a samsung television because i love my old phone so much the s3 was durable as hell i musthave dropped it 100 times before the front glass cracked the lcd still works flawlessly apparently the quality of their products are not uniform across the company and they don't stand behind their products even when they should be under warranty i will never purchase another product from them again be cautious when making a purchase from them,neutral

976,garbage phone i traded in my iphone 5 because i thought this phone looked great in store i previously owned phones way back like the omnia and was hesitant about the samsungs again the size of the phone is about the only redeeming value it's a big screen yes but other than that the rest is downhill call quality horrble i never had an issue with my other iphones or phones this sounds like i'm calling from a bathtub that is when it's not dropping my calls on verizon too try it on speakerphone ha good luck call quality takes another enormous dive responsiveness it lags a lot for me applications are often slow graphics and pictures pictures are pretty decent not bad i get a lot of black screens and have to restart applications when i go from say a twitter link to something else it's black slow to load i thought the phone would be blazing fast but it's way below any iphone or even other phones my wife has the lg g2 and while it's supposed to be fast lg g2 it makes the galaxy note iii look abysmally slow overall i'm greatly disappointed in this phone i switched because i think it had great promise as an all in one type phone but not for me i'm going to trade the phone back in for something else and likely take an incredibly big financial hit for buying this piece of garbage,neutral
